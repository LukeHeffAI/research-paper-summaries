This paper describes a\nresearch project analysing place-based learning for preservice\nteachers at an urban university led by Aboriginal community\nmembers. We argue that place-based learning is critical in developing\npreservice teacher\u2019s knowledge and confidence in Aboriginal\neducation. Surveys, individual and group yarns provided in-depth\ndata from 64 participants completing elective courses including place-\nbased \u2018Learning from Country\u2019 (LFC) experiences. Three key findings\nemerge from the data. Firstly, the utility of an experiential \u2018learning\nby doing\u2019 approach, secondly, the profound shifts in participant\nunderstandings of the diversity of Aboriginal cultures, histories and\ncommunities and thirdly, how these experiences highlighted the\nstrength and presence of the local urban Aboriginal community. These\nfindings suggest that LFC holds promise as a pedagogical strategy to\nimprove teacher capacity in Aboriginal education.\nIntroduction\nThe critical role of teacher quality in improving student outcomes is widely\nacknowledged (Hattie, 2009; Naylor & Sayed, 2014), even more so for those who experience\ndisadvantage such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students (henceforth referred to as\nAboriginal students due to the location of project) (Gillan, et al., 2017). Lack of teacher\nknowledge about and experiences with Aboriginal peoples, cultures and histories either in\ntheir own schooling and/or in their teacher education course (Lowe, et al., 2020) and the\nimpact of racism (Bodkins-Andrews & Carlson, 2016) can make teaching in this space\nfraught with difficulty and inertia (Buxton, 2017). Furthermore, many teachers lack\nconfidence, feel uncomfortable teaching Aboriginal content and fear that they will overstep\ntheir authority if they speak on behalf of Aboriginal people (McKnight, et al., 2019). Some\nteachers perceive Indigenous content as irrelevant to their discipline area or relevant only if\nthey have Aboriginal students in their class (Phillips, 2011).\nWe argue that in order to develop effective teachers in Aboriginal education, we need\nto develop preservice teacher\u2019s critical consciousness (Freire, 1970/2000), in relation to the\nimpact of Eurocentric, assimilatory education practices that have largely failed Aboriginal\nstudents (Lowe, et al., 2020). Growing from this consciousness raising we aim to build\npreservice teacher capacity, confidence and commitment to classroom and whole school\npractices that support Aboriginal identity, student learning and the inclusion of Aboriginal\nVol 46, 1, January 2021 55Australian Journal of Teacher Education\nknowledges in the curriculum. While pathways to consciousness raising can be achieved in a\nclassroom through a diverse range of critical and experience based pedagogies (Norman,\n2012), this paper focuses on research conducted with preservice teachers who engaged in\nAboriginal community-led place-based Learning from Country activities outside the\nclassroom on Country. Country is an Aboriginal English (as different from Standard\nAustralian English) term that describes land as a living entity, the essence of Aboriginality\nand includes the human and non-human; people, culture, spirituality, history, land,\nwaterways, animals, plants, insects, habitats and ecosystems. As Fredericks (2013) explains,\nCountry is the \u201cknowledge, cultural norms, values, stories and resources within that particular\narea \u2013 that particular Indigenous place\u201d (p. 6). The key aim of \u2018Learning from Country in the\nCity\u2019 (henceforth referred to as Learning from Country) is to encourage preservice teachers to\nthink about new approaches to teaching where local Country inspired narratives of place\nbecome a foundation for learning (Wakeman, 2015) supported through classroom and\nassessment processes.\nConsequently, this research aimed to investigate the effects of these Learning from\nCountry (LFC) experiences on preservice teachers\u2019 understandings of Aboriginal peoples,\ncultures and histories, on their understandings of Country and community, and the extent to\nwhich this learning had fostered the development of a critical consciousness. In what follows,\nwe provide the contextual background to and an overview of teaching and learning\nexperiences in the LFC approach and layout the three key concepts informing LFC: critical\nconsciousness, place consciousness and critical pedagogy of place, before explaining the\nresearch design. In discussing the research findings, we highlight the importance that\npreservice teachers (who are participants) attached to the experiential \u2018learning by doing\u2019\npedagogical approach, the profound shifts experienced in their depth of understanding of the\ndiversity of Aboriginal cultures, histories and communities and finally, the extent to which\nthese LFC experiences visibilised the local urban Aboriginal community and Country.\nResearcher Positionality\nOur team of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal lecturers/researchers share a commitment\nto reshaping power relationships through privileging Aboriginal voices to affect Aboriginal\nstudent learning outcomes, curriculum and community engagement. We acknowledge that\nAboriginal sovereignty has never been ceded and as we work on Gadigal Country we believe\nthat this \u2018place\u2019 should be the focus of our efforts to reshape power relations. Katrina is a\nWorimi woman (Aboriginal) postdoctoral research fellow who has taught Indigenous Studies\nin teacher education for over two decades. Cathie is a non-Aboriginal educator has worked in\nAboriginal education for over 35 years and parent of Aboriginal children involved in local\nAboriginal community sports. Suzanne is a non-Aboriginal researcher working in\ncommunity-based family, youth, sexual and domestic violence organisations who is currently\nlearning from interactions with Aboriginal community members and Country.\nBackground\nTeacher professional learning where local Aboriginal community members teach the\nteachers, has been successfully implemented by the NSW Aboriginal Education Consultative\nGroup (AECG) through their Connecting to Country (CTC) program. In this program,\nAboriginal community members take teachers out of school and into their community to\nteach them about local histories, cultures and community priorities. Teachers reported this to\nVol 46, 1, January 2021 56Australian Journal of Teacher Education\nbe a transformative experience that helped them develop more meaningful relationships with\ntheir students, develop better understanding of and therefore teach local knowledge, and\nchallenge stereotypes and prejudices about Aboriginal peoples (Burgess & Cavanagh, 2016).\nMoreover, follow up cultural mentoring for these teachers led by local Aboriginal community\nmembers supported teachers in developing culturally responsive curriculum and pedagogies\nin their classrooms (Burgess, Bishop & Lowe, 2020).\nPrior inclusion of field trips for preservice teachers and the success of CTC and other\ncourses (e.g. Harrison, Page & Tobin, 2016), prompted us to implement a pedagogical\napproach we call \u2018Learning from Country in the City\u2019, embedded in three Aboriginal\neducation electives available to students enrolled in teacher education at an urban university\nin Sydney. Each elective is a 36 hour face-to-face semester course. The elective subjects aim\nto better prepare the largely non-Aboriginal cohort of preservice teachers to apply culturally\nand relationally responsive curriculum and pedagogies to teaching Aboriginal and non-\nAboriginal students when they become teachers.\nIn this study, Learning from Country means learning from Aboriginal peoples,\ncultures, histories, sites and all that Country entails including the interdependent ecologies\nwithin the urban environment. To do this, we employ local Aboriginal community-based\neducators to take preservice teachers into the local community to walk with and listen to\nAboriginal peoples\u2019 narratives of place. This enables preservice teachers to understand that\nthe everyday urban context (such as the university, the adjacent suburbs, local tourist areas\netc) is Country. These experiences occur alongside classroom-based theoretical learning, all\nof which are purposeful and structured in ways to develop deep listening, critical reflection\nand cultural humility. Through this, we hope that preservice teachers will develop their\ncritical consciousness so as to articulate and mobilise a critical pedagogy of place in order to\nengage with their local Aboriginal community and Country to become effective teachers in\nthis area.\nEducation Context\nThis work is driven by a deep concern about the continuing disadvantage Aboriginal\npeople experience through ongoing assimilationist education practices (Burgess & Evans,\n2017). These practices contribute to pervasive misrepresentations and deficit discourses about\nAboriginal peoples, histories and cultures often reinforced by mainstream media and\neducation (Buxton, 2017; Burgess, et al., 2020). Consequently, these views impact\nsignificantly on broader community attitudes towards Aboriginal peoples and cultures and\nperpetuate racism (Bodkin-Andrews & Carlson, 2016), compounding the effects of\ndisadvantage.\nMoreover, the intergenerational legacy of \u2018silencing\u2019 Aboriginal histories and cultures\nalong with repetitive and simplistic teaching of these, continues to marginalise Indigenous\nknowledges (Lowe & Yunkaporta, 2013). Clark\u2019s (2008) research found that Aboriginal\nhistory was \u201ctaught to death, but not in depth [author emphasis]\u201d leading to student\ndisengagement and resistance to this area of learning (p. 67-69).\nIn recognition of the importance of knowledge and understanding relating to\nAboriginal peoples, histories and cultures, the Alice Springs (Mparntwe) Education\nDeclaration (2019) highlights a commitment to developing connections with Aboriginal and\nTorres Strait Islander communities to improve the teaching of Aboriginal histories and\ncultures and Aboriginal student outcomes. It states, \u201cEffective partnerships are based on\nculturally supportive and responsive learning environments\u201d (p.10) and so the LFC project\nresponds to this by preparing preservice teachers to develop critical skills in building\nVol 46, 1, January 2021 57Australian Journal of Teacher Education\nrelationships with local Aboriginal communities and Country to make a difference for\nAboriginal (and indeed all) students.\nPrior to undertaking the elective units where Learning from Country is embedded,\npreservice teachers complete a mandatory Aboriginal education course. This course\nintroduces them to the importance of understanding Aboriginal cultures, histories and\nperspectives in developing curriculum resources and pedagogical approaches in their teaching\npractices. However, the limited time of one semester makes it a challenging task (Thorpe &\nBurgess, 2016) to develop the depth of understanding needed to become effective teachers,\nand so Aboriginal education electives with a LFC focus have been implemented to address\nthis shortfall.\nActivating a Critical Consciousness\nFreire (1970/2000) developed the notion of conscientization which he described as\n\u201clearning to perceive social, political, and economic contradictions \u2013 developing a critical\nawareness \u2013 so that individuals can take action against the oppressive elements of reality\u201d (p.\n35). In the teacher education context, problematising dominant ideologies that silence,\ndiminish and oppress Aboriginal voices is a key step in developing a critical consciousness.\nResearch on educating students in ways that develop their critical consciousness and capacity\nfor self-reflection, emphasises the value and power of pedagogies that draw on authentic\nexamples and realistic situations (Gay & Kirkland, 2003). Teaching for critical consciousness\nfosters critical thinking, in what Kholi et.al (2019) suggest is a \u201ca dynamic and reflexive\napproach to reading the world (text, media, audio, interactions) that strengthens one\u2019s\nunderstanding of power, inequity, and injustice\u201d (p. 25).\nThe LFC pedagogical approach consists of purposeful, structured experiences for\npreservice teachers to learn first-hand from local Aboriginal community-based educators.\nThis includes cultural tours about pre-invasion life around Sydney and the university\ngrounds, and post-invasion experiences illuminating local ecology, resistance sites,\nAboriginal art and Stolen Generation1 survivor narratives which generate understanding of\nthe continuity of political activism, survival and resilience. These Country-centred\nexperiences occur at Australia\u2019s initial site of invasion and so this shapes the significance of\nthis place-based learning as controversial and for some preservice teachers, confronting in\ncontesting Western versions of settlement and progress (Burgess, et al., 2020). Through this\napproach, preservice teachers\u2019 ways of thinking about past and present relationships between\nAboriginal peoples, lands, cultures, histories and communities as well as relationships\nbetween Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people (Polity and Research, 2018) are encouraged.\nTo prepare preservice teachers, address oft expressed fears of not wanting to offend\nAboriginal people and consider the cultural safety of all involved, we discuss culturally\nappropriate, ethical and local protocols to build awareness and confidence early in these\ncourses. We focus on respectful and deep listening to develop reflective understandings and\nfeelings about new experiences of place. We highlight the importance of enacting humility\nand reciprocity to \u2018give back\u2019 to and nourish Country (McKnight, 2016). We also introduce\npreservice teachers to the notion of \u2018Yarning\u2019, an Aboriginal informal, non-linear way of\nconversing and deep listening (Bessarab & Ng\u2019andu, 2010; Shay, 2019) to enact a culturally\nappropriate communication style that respects and listens to all voices.\n1 The term Stolen Generations describes generations of Aboriginal children removed from their families in the 19th and 20th\ncenturies.\nVol 46, 1, January 2021 58Australian Journal of Teacher Education\nPreservice teacher assessment tasks acknowledge the importance of voice through a\nreflective analysis of their experiences, for example, designing a visual learning journal to\nexpress how these experiences might influence their teaching practice. This approach\nempowers preservice teachers as self-reflective learners and develops their critical\nconsciousness through cycles of action, reflection, theorising and change to decolonise and\ntransform knowledges and practices (Arnold, et al., 2012, p. 282).\nThe courses are structured to provide experiential and practical pathways for\npreservice teachers to develop their critical consciousness by listening to Aboriginal\ncommunity-based educators\u2019 lived experiences of colonisation and illuminate place-based\nknowledges, values, and skills. Through the notion of Country we also attempt to build \u2018place\nconsciousness\u2019; an understanding of the layered nature of Aboriginal knowledges that exist in\nthe places these preservice teachers move through everyday.\nPlace Consciousness\nA critical element of LFC is the development of place consciousness, a deep\nunderstanding of the importance of place and the inherent significance of \u2018Country\u2019 in an\nIndigenous framing of place. Place-based learning is commonly used to describe learning\nwhere location is at the centre. This approach emerges from various traditions including\nenvironmental, outdoor, land and community-based education and therefore includes a range\nof definitions (Harasymchuk, 2015). Ruitenberg (2005) offers a critical rendering of place\nconsciousness that resonates with this study:\nEach place has a history, often a contested history, of the people who inhabited\nit in past times. Each place has as aesthetics, offers a sensory environment of\nsound, movement and image that is open to multiple interpretations. And each\n(inhabited) place has a spatial configuration through which power and other\nsocio-politico-cultural mechanism are at play. (p. 215)\nIn developing place consciousness, Aboriginal community-based educators\ndemonstrate how to become open to and experience Country; to understand that it is\neverywhere, alive with stories, people and the non-human world (McKnight, 2016). Marcia\nLangton (1998) notes the limitations of Western understandings of Country when she\ncritiques the concept of Australian \u201cwilderness\u201d as a fantasy, reinforcing terra nullius which\nignores Aboriginal peoples\u2019 knowledge of the \u201ccultural landscapes\u201d that exist across the\nentire continent (p. 18). Likewise, in the densely populated urban landscapes where most\nAustralian\u2019s live, non-Aboriginal people often have trouble grasping that urban places are\nalso Aboriginal places, as Porter (2018) notes, \u201cthis urban country is also urban Country\u201d (p.\n239). As teachers and researchers, it is our aim to awaken preservice teachers to the cultural\nlandscapes of Country so they can build this into their daily practice, wherever they may\nteach.\nPlace-conscious education provides firsthand experience of local life and in the\npolitical processes involved in shaping what happens there (Gruenwald, 2003, p. 620). Local\nAboriginal community-based learning is central to building place consciousness in order that\nwe \u201creconnect the process of education, enculturation, and human development to the well-\nbeing of community life\u201d (Gruenewald and Smith, 2008, p. xvi).\nThe limitations of Western epistemologies and ontologies in describing Aboriginal\npeoples\u2019 deep connection to place have been recognised by a number of Indigenous\nresearchers such as Yunkaporta and Shillingsworth (2020) who note that shallow, tokenistic\ninterpretations implicitly default to \u201cAnglo, colonial and predominately male\u201d (p. 2) versions\nof knowledges, cultures and histories. These entrenched versions continue to erase and deny\nVol 46, 1, January 2021 59Australian Journal of Teacher Education\nAboriginal people\u2019s connection to and understanding of place (Yunkaporta & Shillingsworth,\n2020).\nCritical Pedagogy of Place\nGruenewald\u2019s (2003) critical pedagogy of place provides a lens through which to\nanalyse preservice teachers\u2019 responses to their LFC experiences and the influence this has on\ntheir understanding and approach to teaching and learning. He argues that synthesising the\nmutually supportive \u201ccritical pedagogy\u201d and \u201cplaced-based education\u201d provides the\nintellectual tools to interrogate the complex intersections between culture, education and the\nenvironment. It also reveals how preservice teachers develop their critical consciousness as\nthey are exposed to new ways of valuing, being, knowing and doing (Yunkaporta &\nShillingsworth, 2020). Moreover, Greenwood (previously Gruenewald) (2009) suggests that,\nat its deepest level, critical place-based education is not merely about making\neducation more meaningful or contributing to community life. It is about\nremembering a deeper and wider narrative of living and learning in connection\nwith others and with the land (p. 5).\nFurthermore, Wakeman (2015) argues that Gruenewald\u2019s critical pedagogy of place\ncan be actioned through listening to and learning from individual and collective community\nnarratives; in this instance, listening to and walking on Country with local Aboriginal people.\nBy storying the lived experiences of being Aboriginal with localised relationships to Country,\ncommunity and culture, these diverse voices challenge Western, hegemonic understandings\nof place and reveal the power and agency of Aboriginal people who live, work and educate in\nthese places. Their stories connect the past to the present and future.\nAustralian researcher, Margaret Somerville (2007) proposes that for a critical place\npedagogy to develop, learning must be; embodied, local, and relational to place, be\ncommunicated in stories and other representations and involve a \u201ccontact zone of contested\nplace stories\u201d (p. 153). This involves reciprocal and dialogical processes between people and\nplace and develops in students, deeper, more nuanced understandings of the local\nenvironment. Moreover, Somerville et al. (2011, p. 1) suggest a critical stance that recognises\npower and problematises taken for granted knowledges is necessary to challenge hegemony.\nThrough a recognition of the importance of \u201cself-in-relation to the other\u201d (p. 2), they explore\nhow place pedagogies focus on relational connections between people and places and so\nprovide space for counternarratives. LFC is a way to both describe and analyse what is\nhappening when preservice teachers listen to and learn from Aboriginal people, that fosters\nnew ways of thinking about place (including their place in society), and their roles and\nresponsibilities as teachers on Country. Contiguous to this is an understanding of their\nresponsibility to push back against colonial narratives which espouse deficit discourses about\nAboriginal peoples and cultures. Foregrounding Country as a source of community strength\nand well-being provides a way in which to talk back to these discourses. By facilitating a\ncontext for these new ways of thinking and doing, possibilities for decolonising education\nand schooling practices are enhanced.\nMethodology\nThis paper reports on phase one of a three phase project which, in line with our research\naims and conceptual framing of this study, employs critical Indigenous research methodology\nwhich privileges Indigenous standpoint (Denzin & Lincoln, 2014; Foley, 2003), by\nVol 46, 1, January 2021 60Australian Journal of Teacher Education\npositioning Aboriginal community educator\u2019s voices as foundational to the research. The\nresearch process foregrounds community cultural wealth (Yosso, 2005), underscoring\nAboriginal sovereignty and challenging dominant Western ideologies and cultural hegemony.\nAboriginal community-based educators discussed the project with us in yarning circles to\nfacilitate thinking about LFC and provide guidance. Although most participants in phase one\nare non-Indigenous preservice teachers, we apply the Indigenous method of yarning\n(Bessarab & Ng\u2019andu, 2010; Shay, 2019) premised on Aboriginal ways of constructing and\nsharing knowledge to allow more flexibility in articulating personal and sometimes, difficult\nexperiences. We do this for two reasons. Firstly, we wish to model for preservice teachers,\nAboriginal protocols that include building relationships through the \u2018social yarn\u2019,\n\u2018collaborative yarn\u2019 (Bessarab & Ng\u2019andu, 2010) and respecting voice and secondly, we are\ncognisant of the impact of inappropriate, often harmful Western positivist research that has\nbeen imposed \u2018on\u2019 Aboriginal communities. These processes provide the opportunity to\nengage more fully with Aboriginal ways of knowing, being and doing and potentially unearth\nperspectives that a Western-oriented approach may not reveal (Bessarab & Ng\u2019andu, 2010, p.\n47). The research was guided by three key questions:\n1. What impact does LFC have on preservice teachers\u2019 knowledges and understandings\nof Aboriginal peoples, cultures and histories?\n2. To what extent do preservice teachers develop understandings of Country and\ncommunity through LFC experiences?\n3. To what extent did the LFC activities develop preservice teachers\u2019 critical\nconsciousness and how might this influence their approach to teaching?\nWe employed a case study approach (Harrison et al., 2017) which includes\nquantitative and qualitative data from preservice teachers who participated in LFC\nexperiences from 2018 to 2019. This approach obtains in-depth data of \u2018real-life\u2019\ninterconnected experiences, bounded by time and activity (Harrison et al., 2017), in this case,\nthe one semester courses including the community based LFC activities where the learning\noccurred. This case study provides opportunities to explore how preservice teachers related to\nthe LFC experiences and to Country, each other, the lecturers (who are also the researchers)\nand to the Aboriginal people who led the learning experiences. This relational, dialogic\napproach illuminated the dynamics of change through the co-existence of multiple realities\nand meanings (Harrison et al., 2017).\nOf the 110 students who were enrolled in the electives, 64 (58%) participated in the\nresearch. All preservice teachers undertaking the elective courses were invited to complete\nthe surveys. The quantitative data is one element of the overall data collected and consists of\n64 pre surveys and 48 post surveys. A Likert scale of one to five where a response of one is\nlow and five is high was used. The survey questions were designed to elicit data to explore\nthe research questions and get a broad understanding of shifts in preservice teacher\nknowledge. Participants were asked to self-report their level of knowledge in areas such as;\nAboriginal culture, history and community (four questions), the impacts of colonisation on\nAboriginal peoples, education and the relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal\npeoples (five questions), engaging with Aboriginal families and communities (three\nquestions), and applying this in developing culturally responsive curriculum and pedagogy to\nimprove Aboriginal (and all) student outcomes (seven questions). The survey data informed\nour thinking about how to facilitate the individual yarns and yarning circles.\nThe qualitative data reported on in this paper consists of eight individual yarns and\nfive group yarning circles (2018), a total of 30 participants.2 All students were invited to\n2 Individual participant yarns were given pseudonyms while yarning circle participants are identified by the circle number in\nwhich they participated.\nVol 46, 1, January 2021 61Australian Journal of Teacher Education\nparticipate in the individual yarns and focus yarns. These were audio recorded and\ntranscribed verbatim. The questions were designed to elicit participant\u2019s understanding of the\n\u2018Learning from Country\u2019 concept, their reflections on their experiences of the different\ncomponents. Preservice teachers\u2019 views on the benefits and challenges of learning from and\ninteracting with Aboriginal people and their ideas on how this learning could inform their\nteaching practice were also sought.\nInitial qualitative data analysis involved developing matrixes to identify emerging\nthemes through annotating transcripts and coding in NVivo 11 to extrapolate themes and\naggregate individual and collective responses. These were then reread in relation to the\nresearch questions, the literature and the conceptual framing of the study to reveal relational\nlinks, disconnections, and nuances. These processes of reading, rereading and annotating\nscripts \u201cproduce thick descriptions of social texts characterised by the context of their\nproduction, the intention of their producers and the meanings mobilised in the processes of\ntheir construction\u201d (Kincheloe & McLaren, 2011, p. 294). The social texts emerging from the\nindividual yarns and group yarning circles, reflect the study context and provide an ongoing,\nreflective account of the participants\u2019 experiences and interrelationships that emerged through\nthe processes of LFC. These are triangulated with the survey results to affect a rigorous study\nwhere data collection and analysis are systematically organised into a detailed evidence base\nto identify emerging themes and their relationship to the key concepts (Merriam, 2009).\nLimitations\nThere are three key limitations with this research of which the first two arise from the\nstructure of the university courses that the LFC experiences are embedded. Firstly, as elective\ncourses, the cohorts are small comprising of preservice teachers genuinely interested in\nbecoming effective Aboriginal education teachers and as such, the research findings are\nlikely to be biased towards positive responses. Secondly, the relatively short length of the\ncourses (36 hours each in one semester) on which the research is based curtails the range and\navailability of LFC experiences including the time needed to critically reflect on learning\nwithin this timeframe. Finally, until we analyse the impact of the LFC framework in\nclassrooms when preservice teachers begin teaching (phase 3 of the project), we cannot know\nif this approach is contributing to effective teacher practice in Aboriginal contexts. It is\nimportant to note that this is primarily a qualitative research project that includes a\nquantitative data set to provide a baseline understanding of preservice teacher\u2019s knowledge\nbefore and after completing their course.\nFindings and Analysis\nAt the commencement of each individual yarn and group yarning circle, preservice\nteachers were asked what prompted their interest in the course. As foregrounded in the\nliterature (Herbert, 2019; Moreton-Robinson, et al., 2012), many preservice teachers chose\nthe subject because they felt ill-prepared to teach Indigenous perspectives and engage with\nAboriginal families and communities. While all preservice teachers had prior learning\nthrough their completion of a mandatory Aboriginal education unit, there were mixed views\nregarding the success of this course in developing their confidence and depth of knowledge.\nSome did not believe it was adequate, for example, \u2018I felt that the education we'd received in\nthe core units of our degree on Aboriginal Australians and Aboriginal education in general\nhad not been very good. It had been pretty weak content and not very thorough at all\u2019\nVol 46, 1, January 2021 62Australian Journal of Teacher Education\n(participant, yarning circle 4). Preservice teachers indicated their desire to learn more to\nenable them to contribute to social justice outcomes for Aboriginal people. The elective unit\nattracted Aboriginal preservice teachers who indicated it provided opportunity to give back\nand \u2018be involved\u2019 (Felicity) in an area they were already passionate about. Some preservice\nteachers, mindful of their own limited schooling experiences, were keen to acquire the\nknowledge and skills needed to provide their students with more accurate experiences of\nAustralian Aboriginal peoples, cultures and communities. As this preservice teacher\ncommented about his own schooling \u2018It was just a whole lot of reading from textbooks about\nAboriginal people in past but not about Aboriginal people now in Australia and how we can\nlearn from Aboriginal perspectives and through Aboriginal perspectives\u2019 (participant,\nyarning circle 1). In addition, most expressed concern and frustration that, despite\nundertaking other teacher education courses that stress the importance of \u2018learning by doing\u2019,\nthey had not been provided with opportunities to learn how to teach by doing, or how to put\ntheir theoretical knowledge into practice.\nThe survey data demonstrated a marked increase in preservice teachers\u2019 self-reported\nknowledge about Aboriginal culture, history and community at the end of each course.\nAggregating responses designed to capture this knowledge shows a marked increase from\nless than a quarter (21.4%) who assessed their knowledge level as high prior to undertaking\nLFC compared to over three quarters (84%) after completing the course. Similarly, their\nunderstanding of the ongoing impacts of colonisation on Aboriginal peoples, racism and\nrelationships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples increased from 31.4% who\nscored themselves as high before the course, to 91% who scored themselves as high after the\ncourse. This upward trend continued in student assessment of their capacity to apply their\nlearning to develop culturally responsive curriculum and pedagogy and to engage with\nAboriginal families and communities. Aggregated responses for the former suite of questions\nshowed an increase from just over a quarter (25.3%) to almost all preservice teachers (96%),\nwhile the later rose from under a quarter (21%) to almost 87% (86.6).\nWhile such marked shifts are encouraging, we also wanted to contextualise these\nresults within the more nuanced reflections and insights captured through individual yarns\nand yarning circles. The section below details the key findings from this data.\nVol 46, 1, January 2021 63Australian Journal of Teacher Education\nUnderstanding Aboriginal Impacts of colonisation, the Confidence/skills to engage Culturally responsive\nc cu ol mtu mres u,\nn\nh ii ts it eo sr y and r ae nl da t nio on ns -h Aip\nb\nob re igtw ine ae ln\np\nA eob po lr ei sg inal w fai mth\ni\nlA ieb s/o cr oig min ma ul\nnities\nc pu edrr aic gu ol gu ym and\nFigure 1 Preservice Teacher Pre and Post Survey Responses\nExperiential Pedagogies\nMany preservice teachers noted that LFC experiences exposed them to new ways of\nthinking about and experiencing learning. Preservice teachers enjoyed the LFC experiences\nlargely because they were outside and practical \u2013 something they could replicate in their own\nteaching, as noted by this preservice teacher, \u2018It's giving you the tools and the knowledge of\nhow to reflect on your practices\u2019 (participant, yarning circle 4). As they come to understand\nwho they are in the context of where they are (Wakeman, 2015, p. 58), the interaction\nbetween self, interpersonal and collective reflexivity encourages agency and action, so that\n\u2018you get more involved and learn better when you get to meet people from the community and\nlisten to their experiences and stories\u2019 (participant, yarning circle 3). This preservice teacher\ncontinues, \u2018it also makes it stronger when we walk home together and discuss it as it feels\nmore real and, on the body\u2019.\nImportantly this \u2018practical knowledge\u2019 was constantly and irremeably positioned by\nthe preservice teachers as embodied in the community educators who led them through the\nVol 46, 1, January 2021 64Australian Journal of Teacher Education\nLFC experiences. As demonstrated above, many preservice teachers developed a better\nunderstanding of the notion of Aboriginal knowledges. As Harrison and Greenfield (2011)\nhighlight, teachers often grapple with understanding the difference between Aboriginal\nperspectives and Aboriginal knowledges. While Aboriginal perspectives focus on\nperspectives about Aboriginal people and cultures, Indigenous knowledges are instead\ngrounded in place (Harrison &Greenfield, 2011), and consequently being on Country with\nAboriginal people enabled preservice teachers to grasp the continuing diverse relational\nknowledges that exist between Aboriginal people and city landscapes. This knowledge they\nemphasised, could not be learnt in the classroom. Although preservice teachers had some idea\nabout the impact of colonisation, (e.g. the Stolen Generations) and Aboriginal cultures\ngenerally, they consistently reflected on the depth of understanding that being in the presence\nof Aboriginal people had brought to their consciousness:\nBeing able to learn from Aboriginal people and communities \u2026 they have their\nwhole history with them and when they talk to us, they don't talk about\nthemselves, they talk about their entire community and the history from\nmillions of years ago and that everything has a foundation in something that's\nso big. (participant, yarning circle 4)\nThrough this experience, the participant is developing insights into the significance of\ncollective biographies of place which have been shared over generations, highlighting\nAboriginal values and practices that privileges the connection of the collective to place in\ncontrast to Western values that oftentimes elevates individualism.\nUnderstanding the Diversity of Aboriginal Knowledges\nA key tenet of the LFC approach is privileging Aboriginal voices as expert knowledge\nholders. Preservice teachers were impacted by the opportunity to listen to a diversity of\nAboriginal community-based educators (gender, age, activists, Elders) and so they began to\nquestion unconscious assumptions about how they had come to \u2018know\u2019 Aboriginal peoples\u2019\ncultures and practices. For instance, one preservice teacher noted; \u2018I thought what\u2019s really\ninteresting is the idea that different people have different knowledges and practices \u2026\nreinforcing diversity \u2026 highlighting the complexity of each situation \u2026 it's not what you see\nat face value\u2019 (participant, yarning circle 2). Learning from Aboriginal people about multiple\nAboriginal knowledges and practices prompted her to reflect on her experience of Aboriginal\nculture as one dimensional and invisible/hidden. Hearing diverse voices enriched preservice\nteachers understanding of the different layers of knowledge:\nListening to people from different communities helped me to really see how the\nknowledge was quite different. At the beginning of each talk they would always\nsay, \"This knowledge is knowledge from our community and it is different to\nother communities' knowledge\u201d. People would ask questions about things that\nthey'd learnt in the past and they would say, \"I can't really comment on that\nbecause that's a different group's knowledge. I can't talk about that because\nthat's not my knowledge\u201d. I think the experiences showed me that in the real-\nworld, different knowledge [exists] for each group, each community, but\nactually hearing it from the people's mouths helped me to see that. (Sophie)\nAcknowledging the existence of the diversity of Aboriginal voices also had a\nprofound impact on building understanding that experiencing place was just the beginning of\ntheir learning journey:\nOne thing that Gordon said that I thought was really helpful for us as teachers is,\n\u201cYou know, I don't want you to go away from this being like, \u201cOh, well I heard from\nVol 46, 1, January 2021 65Australian Journal of Teacher Education\nGordon so that's the be all and end all and nothing can be different or disagree and\nchallenge what another Aboriginal person says\". I thought that was really helpful\nbecause I think that perhaps we think, \u201cOh, we've heard it from one Aboriginal\nperson, that is the gospel truth\u201d. (participant, yarning circle 2)\nFurthermore, Somerville\u2019s (2010) suggests that revealing the \u2018intersection of multiple and\ncontested stories\u2019 from Indigenous and Western traditions about the same place, can be\ntheorised as a \u201ccontact zone\u201d (p. 338). She contends that contested stories should be held in\n\u201cproductive tension\u201d (p. 338) for deep learning to occur. This productive tension was noted\nby one preservice teacher who was dubious about some of the claims made by one Aboriginal\ncommunity-based educator:\nThere's very little evidence. But again, this is someone coming from a completely\ndifferent perspective, coming with a lot of pride and so, I was definitely willing\nto listen and critically evaluate... One day, something might come out about that,\nbut I don't think there's anything out there are the moment. (participant, yarning\ncircle 2)\nThe narratives shared by Aboriginal community-based educators exposed preservice\nteachers to stories that reflect diverse social and political lived experiences of Aboriginal\npeople living in urban areas. Uncovering these contested stories is vital to enacting a critical\npedagogy of place (Wakeman, 2015, p. 59). Preservice teachers appreciated the generosity\nand challenge they were tasked with when listening to these complex and layered histories.\nAs the preservice teacher quoted above continues, \u2018you park it and think, \"Okay, well I'll\nleave that, and I'll still respect you. I've still got a lot to learn from you\". So, all that again, is\npart of the complexity of the learning, which was a valuable part of what we learned\u2019. These\nare important opportunities enabling preservice teachers to speak back to essentialised and\nreductionist stereotypes of Aboriginal peoples, cultures and histories as well as opening a\ndialogue to new learning and relationships.\nLearning from diverse perspectives also created enthusiasm about the potential for\nLFC to engage with cross disciplinary learning as Sophie comments, \u2018it engages students so\nmuch more. They also how show they fit with all the other KLAs [such as] science,\ngeography, history. Going out into the bush and walking around with an Aboriginal person,\nlearning about sustainability, it's so closely linked\u2019. It is interesting to note that while the\nLFC experiences were not \u201cin the bush\u201d, Sophie notes the application beyond the urban\ncontext into a range of settings.\nKnowledge of the Local Aboriginal Community\nOne of the key areas of learning identified by participants was a growing awareness of\nthe commonly held stereotype that Aboriginal communities are located in the \u2018outback\u2019 or\n\u2018bush\u2019, and therefore one must travel to remote Australia to experience Aboriginal culture. As\nFelicity comments, she hadn\u2019t realised until she participated in the local walking tours\nthrough her own university, and local tourist spots such as The Rocks area of Sydney \u2018just\nhow much is around us, and how much is local, and how much I didn't know about really . . .\nit\u2019s been there the whole time, but I wouldn't have known about it\u2019. Indeed, for Isabelle, a\npreservice teacher who had worked in a number of rural Aboriginal communities \u2018the biggest\ntakeaway\u2019 from the LFC experiences was realising that what she refers to as \u2018quite a naive\nmisconception [that she] came in with at the beginning that there is not a lot of Aboriginal\nculture alive in Sydney\u2019. She reflects on her experience of being guided through Redfern, that\nalso serves as a transport hub and pedestrian thoroughfare for many university students.\nVol 46, 1, January 2021 66Australian Journal of Teacher Education\nI think the Redfern tour was pretty eye opening [there] was a lot of history. I\nunderstood that Redfern was a significant town for Aboriginal people, but I\ndidn't understand why. And then you got all these stories and I understood it\nheaps more and it made a lot more sense why this is a strong community space.\n(Isabelle)\nLike many university students, Isabelle had some awareness that \u2018Redfern was a significant\ntown for Aboriginal people\u2019 but she had not understood the history and because she could not\nsee the knowledge, the culture and the community, she assumed had been erased. Indeed, the\nsense of local Aboriginal history, knowledge and culture becoming visible was a reoccurring\ntheme, whether expressed through a sense of disconcertion that it was only now, in their final\nyear of study that they had been introduced to this, or an awareness of the extensive history of\nstruggle, resistance and resilience embedded in the Redfern urban environment such as the\nlong history of successful community-controlled organisations in the area.\nMore broadly, the rapport the Aboriginal community-based educators built with the\npreservice teachers appeared significant in enabling them to gain a more grounded\nunderstanding of the ways in which colonisation continues to impact Aboriginal peoples and\ncommunities. The following excerpt describes Frances\u2019s reflections on hearing from\nsurvivors of Kinchela Boys Home3, one of the notorious institutions instrumental in the\ngovernment policy of systematically removing Aboriginal children from their families.\nGetting to meet them, it really hits home as to how much government policies,\nand the actions that followed, have impacted the communities, I mean previous\nto that, I actually knew about Kinchela, I watched a documentary on it, I read\nabout it in a book, I've seen newspaper reports, and I felt like I knew it, but I\ndidn't. You don't know it until someone's standing there talking to you about how\nit has impacted their life and you can see that emotion. You don't get from\ntextbooks or documentaries. Having that face-to-face connection with someone,\nand, even though they're talking to an entire room, I think everyone in that room\nfelt that personal connection. That one hour with them was worth, probably\n10,000 hours for me. (Danielle)\nImportantly, the preservice teachers extrapolated from these narratives ways in which\nboth the history of and current institutional racism manifests in government policies, and so\nthis structures the way Aboriginal students, and their families may react to the institutions\nsuch as education. There appeared a heightened awareness of the ways that these experiences\ncan play out through a lack of trust, fear and reluctance to engage with teachers and schools:\nLike the talk we had at the community centre, acknowledging the fact that a lot\nof Aboriginal Australians had poor experiences with education. So, there are\nvery good reasons why they might not be comfortable and might not want to\nconnect with us. Again, it was like, Duh, but, so helpful to think about this\nbecause that can really affect how to approach in my teaching (participant,\nyarning circle 4).\nFinally, participants highlighted the importance of the practical knowledge and\nguidance they had received on how to engage with and develop relationships with Aboriginal\ncommunities. As this preservice teacher highlights, \u2018A lot of subjects will be like, it\u2019s really\nimportant that you establish these relationships, but they don\u2019t actually give you any\npractice, they\u2019re just like, do it, and you\u2019re like, Great, but how do I do it?\u2019 (participant,\nyarning circle 4).\n3 The survivors who talk about their experiences receive training and support from the NGO with whom they are affiliated.\nTypically, the preservice teachers are just one of a number of education, community and industry groups with whom the\nsurvivors generously share their knowledge and lived experiences.\nVol 46, 1, January 2021 67Australian Journal of Teacher Education\nAs a result of LFC experiences, preservice teachers felt confident in contacting\nAboriginal organisations such as local AECG\u2019s once they embarked on their teaching careers\nas they now have a sense of \u2018the protocols for knowing your place, and knowing what you\ncan do that's actually going to maintain relationships or be helpful\u2019 (Felicity). Participants\nrecognised the importance in enabling relationships based on notions of reciprocity, of their\nrole in the work they needed to do in \u2018learning to give and take\u2019 (Danielle) and of the time\nneeded to build trusting relationships as Michael indicates \u2018as a teacher, you need to earn\nyour stripes, you need to demonstrate that you're worthy of trust\u2019. Indeed, Danielle, a\npreservice geography teacher, is clearly excited at the ways she has been able to incorporate\nher learning about local plants and sustainability into her practicum lesson plans and quite\nperceptively points out its \u2018when you don't have that practical knowledge that can stop a lot\nof people from actually going ahead and making those sort of connections\u2019 . . . because of the\nfear of \u2018just screwing up and offending people\u2019. She further noted that \u2018the biggest impact of\nthis course, [is] the confidence to go out and engage which sounds easy but can be quite\nnerve-racking\u2019. Indeed, for a number of preservice teachers, their LFC experiences seemed to\nhave reinforced very real and concrete ways the responsibility incumbent on them \u2013 as\n(predominantly) non-Indigenous Australians \u2013 when approaching Aboriginal community\nmembers.\nCounternarratives\nChallenging dominant ideologies and assumptions about Indigenous peoples and\ncultures through privileging counternarratives lies at the heart of the LFC project. Without\nthis epistemological and ontological stance, opportunities to challenge Western hegemonic\nideologies, assumptions and discourses will be limited. The need to learn from Country as a\npedagogical experience (Harrison, 2017) in order to challenge mainstream approaches to\nAboriginal education is noted by this participant \u2018I think one of the big things is that as soon\nas you're on Country and talking to Aboriginal people, it completely mitigates the tokenism\nwhich is so ubiquitous in the education system\u2019 (participant, yarning circle 2). This\nobservation reflects the all too common school experience of surface level learning in\nAboriginal histories and cultures which disengages many school students and reinforces the\nstereotypes and misinformation that reproduce the deficit discourses.\nOpportunities for Aboriginal community-based educators to convey their narratives of\nplace, history, cultures and lived experiences provide for many preservice teachers,\ncounternarratives of otherwise superficial understandings. This is evident in this participant\u2019s\nobservation that, \u2018they are able to speak about their own history, to present it in the way that\nthey want to instead of us reading a book and having our own thoughts \u2026 I think that's pretty\nspecial\u2019 (participant, yarning circle 2). For Aboriginal people, the opportunity to articulate\nexperiences of colonial oppression and witness positive responses from preservice teachers\nsupports healing through the restorative power of stories, as this participant suggests; \u2018I think\nthey also feel heard, validated. Uncle Percy said that sharing helps his healing. Because\nthese things aren't discussed, us listening and hearing that story has flow on effects, which\nultimately will be positive for Aboriginal communities\u2019 (participant, yarning circle 2).\nWhile most preservice teachers had some existing knowledge of Aboriginal\nexperiences of colonisation, hearing the lived experiences of Stolen Generation survivors,\nenabled a concrete understanding of how these injustices continue today. A number of\npreservice teachers commented that this helped them to understand the ongoing impact of\nintergenerational trauma on families and communities. Danielle notes:\nVol 46, 1, January 2021 68Australian Journal of Teacher Education\nLooking at disadvantaged communities today, the fact that having your culture\nstolen away from you can have effects from that. This is how you can end up\nwith drinking problems and people\u2026[have] lost their language and their\nchildren have been raised with a different language.\nHearing counternarratives illuminating the resilience of Aboriginal knowledges in urban\nplaces prompted this preservice teacher to rethink her understanding of history as follows:\nThe depth of immersion and the history in the stories and in the lives of people,\nand for me, that all came back to the Country and community even though it's\nseen as historical, it's living now, and it's still being shaped \u2026 because it's our\ncountry as well and we should be interacting with it as much as we can.\n(participant, yarning circle 2)\nThis preservice teacher\u2019s sense of a collective biography of place, \u2018our country\u2019, indicates\nthat she is beginning to view Country through a deeper and more nuanced lens. These\nexperiences raised broader questions for preservice teachers such as; what is happening in\nthis place, who are we in this place, whose voices are heard (Wakeman, 2015, p. 57) and\nwhat are the shared responsibilities in shaping future narratives that are inclusive of\nAboriginal people. These critical questions support the learner to better understand the \u201cfalse\nbinary of \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019, and instead provide openings for discursive struggle showing the\ncomplexity and scope of cultural understanding\u201d (Acton, et al., 2017, p. 1321).\nDiscussion\nThe research questions which framed the study focussed on revealing the impact of\nLFC experiences on firstly; preservice teacher\u2019s knowledge and understanding of Aboriginal\npeople, culture, and histories; secondly on their understandings of \u2018Country\u2019 and community;\nand finally, on how these experiences developed their critical consciousness to influence their\napproach to curriculum and pedagogy.\nIn response to the first research question, preservice teachers deepening understanding\nof place consciousness through an Aboriginal lens had a significant impact on their\nknowledge and understandings of Aboriginal peoples, cultures and histories. The diverse\nrange of experiences afforded the opportunity to listen to Aboriginal community-based\neducators\u2019 lived experiences of colonisation, rather than relying on textbook accounts, and so\nthese stories became counternarratives revealing new ways of engaging with\nIndigenous knowledges, experiences, values and skills. Importantly, the LFC\npedagogical approach invoked more than just the \u2018experiential\u2019; by being on Country,\npreservice teachers developed insight to the layered nature of Aboriginal knowledges that\npersist around them in the places they traverse in their everyday lives. Indeed, it was the\nextent to which the LFC experiences made visible urban Country, together with the profound\neffects of relationship building with the Aboriginal community-based educators, that appear\nkey to the preservice teachers shifts in understanding or capacity to reflect on their\nassumptions about a perceived \u2018loss\u2019 or absence of Aboriginal cultures and communities in\nurban contexts.\nThe second research question is significant as our findings provide evidence for the\nimportance of engaging with Aboriginal peoples and communities to bring to life and make\nrelevant local histories, cultures and places. As making meaningful connection with\nAboriginal families and communities is an area of uncertainty and tension for teachers, for\nthese preservice teachers LFC gave them the tools and confidence to engage with Aboriginal\nfamilies and communities when they begin their teaching career. Significantly, as Sophie\nnoted, that even when listening to difficult narratives, the Aboriginal community-based\nVol 46, 1, January 2021 69Australian Journal of Teacher Education\neducators created an atmosphere of belonging and inclusion, \u2018I felt like they were wanting to\nteam up with us a little bit. They often were saying, \u2018You're the future teachers. We need to\nwork together to improve things for our kids and everything\u2019. Being on Country with\nAboriginal community-based educators provided the first practical steps in understanding\nhow relationships can emerge between Aboriginal people, teachers, students and place. LFC\nfacilitated a sense of belonging for many preservice teachers who could imagine ways of\nenacting \u2018Country-informed\u2019 teaching. This sense of inclusion and shared belonging is\ncritical for the development of community-informed knowledges and practices that teachers\ncan implement in their classrooms.\nThe final research question asked to what extent preservice teachers were able to\ndevelop a critical consciousness, and to that end, we found that through deliberate and\nconstructive reflexivity in class and through assessment, preservice teachers developed their\ncritical consciousness and consequently, felt confident in their newly acquired knowledges\nand skills to implement this in less tokenistic ways. By understanding personal positioning in\nrelation to Country, and through exposure to Aboriginal ways of knowing, being and doing,\nopportunities to mobilise a critical consciousness became an important element of the\njourney. Preservice teachers such as Michael, noted the significance of Aboriginal education\nas an \u2018important area in Australian society, of who we should become. It is powerful, you can\nreally play a role in pushing ... to try and bring society along\u2019. Opportunities to implement\nAboriginal communication protocols such as deep listening, yarning and cultural humility\ndeveloped practical enactments of critical consciousness and prompted preservice teachers to\narticulate this with their own families, as this participant from yarning circle 2 noted, \u2018with\nmy father, we talked about \"What have you learned?\" and from this course, I have so much to\nsay and I'm like, \"Oh, I did this and we met these people and this is so influential\u201d\u2019.\nOpportunities to influence non-Indigenous people beyond the classroom is an important\ncontribution to sovereignty awareness, reparative activism and decolonisation (Burgess,\nBishop & Lowe, 2020).\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, LFC contains a number of elements which contribute to the process of\ndecolonising education through nurturing relational connections between Country and the\npeople who hold the cultural, social and political narratives of place. Central to this is\nrejecting deficit discourses about Aboriginal peoples and cultures and instead, making visible\nAboriginal knowledges through a strength-based paradigm where community-based\neducators develop preservice teacher\u2019s capacity to better understand, engage and teach on and\nwith Country.\nImportantly, the preservice teachers observed that the Aboriginal community-based\neducators frequently expressed their desire to educate teachers so that better relationships can\nbe built between schools, parents and communities to improve the educational outcomes of\ntheir children and grandchildren. Moreover, preservice teachers noted the importance of\nAboriginal voice in acknowledging and understanding the impact of colonisation and\nongoing injustices, and the criticality of bringing this knowledge into the curriculum.\nGiven we recognise Country as the centre of this learning, this means that all\nAustralian education institutions are situated on Country and therefore within an Aboriginal\ncontext. The key implication here is that the LFC approach can be mobilised as a foundation\nfor learning in all education institutions, not just those with significant Aboriginal student\npopulations. It also indicates that a commitment to educating non-Aboriginal preservice\nVol 46, 1, January 2021 70Australian Journal of Teacher Education\nteachers, teachers and school students through Learning from Country experiences is critical\nto the process of decolonising education.\nAcknowledgements\nEthics was approved through the University of Sydney ethics process: Protocol\nnumber 2018/227.\nReferences\nActon, R., Salter, P., Lenoy, M., & Stevenson, R.

Competence, for instance, implies the attainment of a proficient level of\nknowledge and/or skills, assumedly identified via some form of testing or measurement.\nCONTACTCathieBurgess cathie.burgess@sydney.edu.au FacultyofEducationandSocialWork,Universityof\nSydney,ManningRd,Sydney,NSW2006,Australia\n\u00a92017InformaUKLimited,tradingasTaylor&FrancisGroup478 C.BURGESS\nThis works well for measuring demonstrable skills, but difficult for complex, abstract\nconcepts like culture. There are a number of definitions of culture, many of which\nacknowledge this complexity and diversity. For instance, Clifford Geertz\u2019s (1973) notion\nofcultureascontextual and fluidratherthanas \u2018entity\u2019and\u2018static\u2019illustratesthatculture\nshouldnotbeneatlyframedorreducedasnoticeablepatternsofbehaviour.Rather,itlies\nwithinthelearnedmeaningsbehindthesesuchasbodylanguage,rituals,artefacts,etc.and\nthatmeaningsareoftenmisinterpretedbythosenotpartoftheculturalgroup.Therefore,\nthe lack of any standard, generally accepted definition of culture and the dangers of\nimposing one, makes measurementpointless ifnotobsoleteactivity.\nPerhapsamoreeffectivewaytoconsiderthenotionofculturalcompetenceistothink\naboutwhoaculturallycompetentpersonmightbeandhowtheymightenactthisintheir\ndaily practice. The who is the teacher who is aware of and constantly developing their\ncritical consciousness through ongoing reflection on personal positioning with reference\ntorelationshipsofpower,whiteness,privilegeandthecontinuingimpactofcolonisationin\nsettler economies like Australia. The how refers to the development of culturally respon-\nsive schooling for student diversity, which places the student at the centre and acknowl-\nedges their ethnic and cultural identities, lived experiences and community contexts as\nassets (McInerney, 2009) in curriculum and pedagogy. This notion of pedagogy \u2018shifts,\nchanges, adapts, recycles and recreates instructional spaces to ensure that consistently\nmarginalised students arerepositioned into a place of normativity \u2013 that is,theybecome\nthe subjects in the instructional process, not mere objects\u2019 (Ladson-Billings, 2014, p. 76).\nThe development of a pedagogical cultural identity (Burgess, 2016) entrenches the who\nandhowintoaprofessionalidentitybyembeddingtacitculturalknowledge,livedexperi-\nence,passionandskillsintopedagogicalpracticeinordertocriticallyreflectontheselfas\ncultural being,teacherand learner(Burgess,2016,p.109).\nThis paper analyses how a teacher professional learning programme, the New\nSouth Wales (NSW) Aboriginal Education Consultative Group (AECG) Connecting\nto Country (CTC) cultural immersion programme delivered by local Aboriginal\npeople, has been successful in supporting the development of teacher critical con-\nsciousness and a pedagogical cultural identity. Evidence from an evaluation of the\nprogramme (Burgess & Cavanagh, 2013) identified significant improvements in\nacknowledging the impact of Australia\u2019s colonial legacy, rejecting deficit discourses\nabout Aboriginal peoples and understanding that Aboriginal culture is dynamic and\nfluid rather than static. Teachers also reported a growing confidence in developing\nculturally responsive pedagogies that affirmed student identities, implemented place-\nbased curriculum and built relationships with Aboriginal parents and community\nmembers (Burgess & Evans, 2017; Kearney, McIntosh, Perry, Dockett, & Clayton,\n2014). Therefore, I argue that this approach challenges commonly understood\nnotions of cultural competence training because it is local, contextual and empowers\nthe cultural knowledge holders (Tanaka et al., 2007) as experts and change agents in\ntheir communities.\nBackground\nCultural competence training has emerged largely in this country in health and social\nservices (see Australian Association of Social Workers, 2015; National Health andCRITICALSTUDIESINEDUCATION 479\nMedical Research Council, 2006) and is currently gaining momentum in education,\nparticularlyinteacherprofessionallearning(Perso,2012).Culturalcompetencetraining\ntends to consist of general checklists or accreditation requirements such as the\nAustralian Professional Standards for Teachers (ATSIL, 2014). In these standards,\nonly 2 of the 37 focus areas refer to Aboriginal and Torres strait Islander students\n(henceforth referred to as Aboriginal students). Notions such as addressing racism,\naffirming cultural identities and teaching for social justice are absent despite these\nimperatives underpinning the Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for\nYoung Australians (MCEETYA, 2008).\nIn these neo-liberal, financially conservative times (Connell, 2013), online teacher\nprofessional learning options are increasingly popular as they are cost/time effective.\nThis is concerning in areas such as cultural competence in Aboriginal contexts because\nit means that one could successfully complete an online course without meeting an\nAboriginal person. Of further concern is the generalist nature of these courses because\nthey tend to promote a pan-Aboriginal view that invariably fosters generalisations and\nstereotypes. Further, as education department policy documents emphasise the impor-\ntance of schools consulting with local Aboriginal communities (New South Wales\nDepartment of Education and Training [NSW DET], 2009), teacher professional learn-\ning that does not do this is questionable at best.\nThe range of definitions and conceptual differences about cultural competence\nrenders it problematic, especially when the people whose culture the training is about\nare not involved in developing or delivering the training. Contrary to this trend, the\nNSW AECG developed a teacher professional learning programme, \u2018Being culturally\naware, becoming culturally inclusive: A pathway to cultural competence\u2019 (Williams,\n2010), commonly referred to as the CTC programme. The NSW AECG is the peak\nAboriginal agency providing advice to the Minister for Education on behalf of\nAboriginal communities. Through the Report on the Review into Aboriginal\nEducation (New South Wales Aboriginal Education Consultative Group Incorporated\nand New South Wales Department of Education and Training [NSW AECG & NSW\nDET], 2004), the AECG identified a lack of teacher awareness and understanding of\nlocal Aboriginal peoples, cultures and histories as negatively impacting on Aboriginal\nstudent outcomes. They secured government funding to deliver local cultural immer-\nsion workshops to teachers highlighting a significant shift in power from the state to\nlocal Aboriginal communities. Notably, the localised and personalised nature of the\nprogramme has been highly successful.\nThe3-dayCTCprogrammeconsistsofactivitiessuchasculturalsitevisits,fieldtrips\nto local Aboriginal organisations, yarning with Elders, community members and\nfamilies, and listening to Aboriginal students talk about their school experiences.\nEvaluation of this programme (Burgess & Cavanagh, 2013) produced substantial evi-\ndence ofthe transformative nature ofdeveloping genuinerelationships with Aboriginal\nparents and community for teachers who then build these understandings and skills\ninto their daily teaching practice.\nThe design and success of this programme reflects key tenets of Indigenous knowl-\nedge systems (Martin, 2009; Nakata, 2002; Phillips, 2011; Yunkaporta, 2009). These\ninclude acknowledging Aboriginal ways of knowing, doing and being, abiding by\nAboriginal protocols and communication processes, focussing on relationships and480 C.BURGESS\nnotions of reciprocity, understanding and working within specific historical, social and\ncultural contexts, and privileging Aboriginal voices and experiences (Martin &\nMirraboopa, 2003). New opportunities for teachers to learn from and about their\nlocal Aboriginal community has resulted in a process of rejecting deficit discourses\nabout Aboriginal people and culture and has contributed to the development of\npersonal and professional critical consciousness (Gay & Kirkland, 2003).\nContext\nWhile this paper draws on international research (see Brayboy & Castagno, 2009; Gay,\n2000; Perso, 2012), the study is located in the Aboriginal Australian educational\ncontext, framing an understanding of the complexities of cultural competence in this\ncountry. An understandingofthe politics ofrepresentationof Aboriginalpeoples, their\nculture, history and society and the influence this has had on Aboriginal and non-\nAboriginalrelationshipsiscrucialtounderstandingthesignificanceofthesuccessofthe\nCTC programme.\nSince invasion, Aboriginal people have been categorised to the extent that in 1986\nlegal historian John McCorquodale (1986) found over 700 pieces of legislation describ-\ning, defining and categorising Aboriginal people broadly grouped as racial identifica-\ntion,territorialhabitation,\u2018blood\u2019/descentandsubjectiveidentification.TheNewSouth\nWales Aboriginal Education Consultative Group (NSW AECG, 2011) notes that \u2018from\ntheearliestdaysofinvasionandcolonisation,whitepeoplehavegrappledwiththeissue\nand constructed and applied definitions of Aboriginality to primarily serve their own\npurposes and to marginalise and oppress Aboriginal peoples\u2019 (p. 4). These representa-\ntions are underpinned by populist notions of culture as a fixed and essential entity,\nespousing binary opposites and reinforcing reductionism in \u2018holidays and heroes\u2019\nunderstandings of culture (Keddie, 2012, p. 319). These \u2018assumptions produce and\nnaturalise the other\u2019 (p. 320), as well as silence, inferiorise and position Aboriginal\npeople as deficient. Since 2009, reports such as the annual Australian government\n\u2018Closing the Gap\u2019 report, terminology like disadvantage, accelerating progress, trans-\nparency and accountability, \u2018 describes this \u2018gap talk\u2019 as a discursive strategy that serves\npolitical purposes by deflecting attention away from the actual scale of the disparity,\nwhilst concurrently masking incremental improvements\u2019 (Vass, 2014, p. 183). This\nrhetoric speaks to non-Aboriginal discourses of condescension, indifference, resent-\nment and blame.\nHow these representations play out in the education system is evident in relatively\npoor Aboriginal student outcomes compared to non-Aboriginal students (Vass, 2014).\nStatistics indicate that Indigenous educational outcomes in literacy, numeracy, atten-\ndance and Year 12 completion are still well below non-Indigenous Australians.\nExacerbating this is the current monolingual, hegemonic education system shaped by\nEurocentric values, beliefs and practices which reproduces, normalises and embeds\nwhite, middle-class understandings of education (Lowe & Yunkaporta, 2013), thus\ncompounding the inequality and oppression of non-whites (Smyth & Wrigley, 2013).\nGiven that the teaching population is also largely white, middle class, an overall lack of\nunderstanding of Aboriginal and minority students contributes to the cycle of failure\nand severely limits their life chances. This then pre-empts the need for teacherCRITICALSTUDIESINEDUCATION 481\nprofessional learning that addresses these key issues as well as the power imbalances\nbetween teachers, students, parents and Aboriginal community members. Cultural\ncompetence theories and practices are often drawn upon to develop effective teacher\nprofessional learning, but there are many limitations and criticisms of this approach in\ndelivering effective and sustainable changes.\nProblematising cultural competence\nWhile cultural competence service learning has found traction in health and social\nservices, it is less popular in education because it is often described in terms of service\nprovision for clientele (Grote, 2008, p. 5). These terms are not commonly used or\naccepted in education as they imply a simplistic, transactional approach to education\nthatpositionsstudentsaspassiverecipientswhileunderminingthecomplexanddeeply\nhumanistic dimensions of teaching (Smyth, 2012). Further, social and relational factors\ninherentinmulticultural,diverseand/orIndigenouscontextsarenotaddressedandthis\ntendstofocusonthe\u2018Other\u2019asdifferent(ofteninterpretedasdeficit)ratherthanonthe\nhierarchical nature of power relationships that exist in colonial systems such as\nAustralia. In fact as Pon (2009) suggests, this common understanding of cultural\ncompetence creates a new form of racism that conveniently ignores the devastating\nimpact of colonialism and oppression on relationships with non-Aboriginal people and\nauthorities.\nCultural competence is commonly conceptualised through a broad range of defini-\ntions (see Perso, 2012; Universities Australia, 2011) as an approach that \u2018limits its goals\nto knowledge of characteristics, cultural beliefs, and practices of non-majority groups,\nand skills and attitudes of empathy and compassion\u2019 (Pon, 2009, p. 783). Kumagai and\nLypson (2009) suggest that while personal development of appropriate attitudes, values\nand beliefs can occur, this does not necessarily involve \u2018the fostering of a critical\nawareness-a critical consciousness-of self, others, and the world\u2019 (p. 782), therefore\nignoring and/or misrepresenting ethnicity, culture and difference (Hollinsworth, 2013,\np. 1050). It also fails to acknowledge the importance of relationality, localisation and\nreciprocity embedded in Indigenous knowledge systems (Martin, 2009). Consequently,\nmany cultural competence training programmes are unlikely to engage participants at\nthe deeper level of challenging personal values, beliefs and attitudes, or power imbal-\nances that occur at the school and classroom level.\nFurther, technical approaches to cultural competence imply that culture is static,\none-dimensional and not influenced by history, change or power relationships. It\nessentialisesthe\u2018Other\u2019intofixedprejudgedcategories,carryingtheriskof\u2018objectifying\nindividuals whose appearance, language, national origin, religion, or sexual orientation\nis different into overly simplistic categorical descriptions of character and behaviour\u2019\n(Kumagai & Lypson, 2009, p. 783). Not only does this presuppose binary understand-\ningsofcultureandethnicity,itdeniesthelegitimacyofthosewhodon\u2019tfitstereotypical\nversions and fails to acknowledge individual multiple identity positions.\nThis focus reinforces what is \u2018normal\u2019 and becomes a benchmark upon which to\njudge all others, basing individual autonomy and choices on a sense of superior\nknowledge and universal values that engenders a misplaced confidence in those \u2018who\nare often anxious about their effectiveness with \u2018others\u2019 or who are frightened of being482 C.BURGESS\nracist\u2019 (Hollinsworth, 2013, p. 1051). The deficit thinking implicit in this stance\nreinforces power relations and perpetuates a negative paradigm where Aboriginal\npeople are generally blamed for their own disadvantage (Vass, 2012, p. 88).\nIn research studies such as the Systematic Implications of Pedagogy and\nAchievement in NSW public schools, Amosa, Ladwig, Griffiths, and Gore (2007)\nidentify links between low teacher expectations, poor pedagogical practice, low quality\nassessment tasks and poor academic results, particularly for Aboriginal and low socio-\neconomic background students. This seminal study found that while high quality\nassessment tasks contributed to \u2018closing the gap\u2019 for Aboriginal students, the majority\noftasks onlyrequiredstudents toaddressknowledgefromwhite, middle-classperspec-\ntives. This research identifies the need for effective teacher professional development\nthat prioritises culturally responsive learning environments and inclusive pedagogies to\nembed multicultural, Aboriginal and minority perspectives into curriculum.\nBuehler, Ruggles, Dallavis., and Haviland (2009, p. 410) report that the emo-\ntional, contextual and racial dimensions of intercultural teaching are often not\nclearly articulated in cultural competence frameworks, yet demand attention if\nthey are to be effective. Zembylas\u2019 (2013) claim that emotions are structured by\nsociocultural contexts, relationships and power relations, highlights the connection\nbetween emotion and values and the need to reflect on \u2018how we see the \u2018Other\u2019 and\nthe world around us, and how we relate to issues of discrimination and inequality\u2019\n(Jokikokko & Uitto, 2016, p. 3). Jokikokko and Uitto (2016) suggest that teacher\ncritical reflection of one\u2019s own beliefs, values and attitudes can \u2018threaten people\u2019s\ncore beliefs and create powerful (often negative) feelings\u2019 (p. 3), thus facilitating or\nhindering a teacher\u2019s attempt to structure meaning and navigate change in their\nspecific context. Working through the emotional aspects of teaching is crucial to\nengaging with discourses about race, diversity, social justice and the power relation-\nships that underpin these in developing a critical consciousness (Gay & Kirkland,\n2003; Kumagai & Lypson, 2009).\nSimilarly, cultural competency frameworks tend not to account for understanding\nhow the sociocultural and political context of specific sites influences teacher\u2013\nstudent relationships. Ladson-Billings (1995) notes that many students \u2018have little\nor no understanding of their own culture; notions of Whiteness are taken for\ngranted\u2019 (p. 96). This not only normalises and maintains the status quo but also\nevokes the notion of \u2018color-blindness\u2019 (Delpit, 1995), further impeding the acquisi-\ntion of cultural competence (Buehler et al., 2009, p. 410). Kumagai and Lypson\n(2009) also suggest that \u2018if social justice is an educational goal of cultural compe-\ntency, discussions of racism should be prevalent in curriculum content: however,\nonly 2 of the 34 different cultural competency curricula studied by Beach et al.\n(2005) involved discussions of racism\u2019 (p. 782). Nicholls (2009) notes that a deep\nunderstanding and practice of reflexivity is crucial here and suggests three levels of\nreflexivity be undertaken: transparent self-reflexivity to critique hidden assumptions,\ninterpersonal reflexivity to assess relationships and collective reflexivity to evaluate\nthe collaboration process in the development of the relationships. Attending to these\nlayers provides a deeper understanding of the relationships of power, the central\nrole of personal positioning and the impact of a racialized education system in\nmarginalising the \u2018Other\u2019. Of further relevance here is Pon\u2019s (2009) claim thatCRITICALSTUDIESINEDUCATION 483\ncultural competency does not adequately acknowledge the devastating impact of\ncolonisation and oppression including the consequent ongoing power issues. He\nnotes that this form of racism continues \u2018othering\u2019 non-whites through ignorance of\nthe contested histories of settler societies as well as reductionist views of culture.\nProblematizing one-dimensional approaches to cultural competency training is\ntherefore essential in addressing these key concerns.\nMethodology\nIn 2011, the NSW AECG identified 14 schools to participate in the programme\nevaluation conducted by the Aboriginal Studies Association External Research Team\n(Burgess&Cavanagh,2013).Thisincludedsevenhighschools,sixprimaryschoolsand\none central school across five Department of Education regional, rural and isolated\nareas where low socio-economic circumstances and poor access to employment and\neducational opportunities are prevalent. Participating teachers, parents and community\nmembers, and school students volunteered to participate in the evaluation. This\nresulted in 54 teacher interviews, 27 parent/community member interviews and 14\nstudentfocusgroups(99studentsfrom10to16yearsofage),providingrichsourcesof\ndata. Questionnaire-style evaluations designed and administered by the AECG to 357\nteacher participants included both closed- (Yes/No binary questions) and open-ended\nresponses.TheseelicitedinformationaboutparticipantknowledgeofAboriginalhistory\nandculture,confidenceinengagingwiththelocalAboriginalcommunityandincluding\nAboriginal content in their lessons. The statistics cited later are calculated from the\nclosed responses. These results were included in the analysis to enhance our depth of\nunderstanding of participant experiences. This mixed methods approach included\nanalysis within and across sites providing important data triangulation, enhancing the\nvalidity and reliability of the findings (Creswell, 2009; Miles & Huberman, 1994).\nThe required ethics approval was obtained from the NSW Department of Education\nand ongoing consultation with the AECG ensured that the research proceeded appro-\npriately. As consenting volunteers, participants were provided with information about\nthe research study including options to withdraw if needed, and copies of their inter-\nview transcript to comment on if they wished.\nForthepurposesofthispaper,thefindingsandanalysisarebasedmainlyonteacher\nresponses in order to fully explore the issue of teacher professional learning in devel-\nopingculturalcompetency.Somecommunitycommentsareincludedastheyshedlight\nontheirperceptionofteachers\u2019values,attitudesandreactionstotheculturalimmersion\nexperiences.\nInitial impact of the CTC experience\nIn the interviews and anonymous evaluations, teachers overwhelmingly reported that\nthe CTC programme had improved their knowledge and understanding of local\nAboriginal people, histories and cultures and enhanced their confidence in incorporat-\ning authentic Aboriginal perspectives into the curriculum. Further, participants\nreported developing increased confidence through new skills in communicating with\nAboriginal people and gaining new awareness of the benefits of this for Aboriginal484 C.BURGESS\nstudent outcomes. This is supported by statistics compiled from the AECG\nquestionnaires:\n\u25cf 98% increased their knowledge and understanding of local Aboriginal people,\nhistory and culture;\n\u25cf 91% adopted new approaches to teaching Aboriginal history and culture;\n\u25cf 81% changed their approach to teaching Aboriginal students;\n\u25cf 84% felt more confident and willing to build relationships with Aboriginal\nfamilies; and\n\u25cf 95% stated that they would recommend the CTC experience to other teachers.\nSignificantly, participants overwhelmingly reported positive responses to the life\nstories of local Aboriginal people because the immediacy and temporality of these\nstories struck a deep chord as one teacher notes, \u2018it really got me, and that\u2019s the\nthing, that\u2019s why it was good\u2019. Many commented that although they had previously\nlearnt aspects of this history, they had not realised how raw this emotional experience\nstillisforAboriginalfamilies.Thisisreflectedincommentssuchas,\u2018Ididn\u2019trealisethe\nextentofhowmuchiteffectedthecurrentgenerationwe\u2019vegotatschool.Sothatwasa\nreal insight\u2019. Many participants also commented that this experience provided oppor-\ntunities to meet Aboriginal people in non-school settings for the first time. They were\noftensurprisedthattheysharedmanyattitudes,aspirationsandculturalcommonalities\nwithAboriginalparentsandwerehumbledbythewayinwhichtheywereacceptedand\nwelcomed despite local tensions. Poignantly, the participants were in fact experiencing\npedagogical approaches that Aboriginal people often express a preference for such as\n\u25cf the importanceof socialinteractionand developmentofmeaningful relationships;\n\u25cf the acknowledgement of land, place and kin relationships as the embodiment of\ncultural knowledge;\n\u25cf adequate time to learn, assess and reflect on new knowledge, understandings and\nskills; and\n\u25cf informal learning and participatory hands on activities, particularly outdoor\nactivities.\nBeyond cultural competence\nThe CTC programme makes a significant contribution to the complex and nuanced\narticulations of culturally responsive schooling. This approach emphasises the impor-\ntance of culturally informed and appropriate pedagogies to engage minority students\nanddevelopthecriticalthinkingskillsneededtochallengetheinherentinequitiesinthe\neducation system (Bishop & Berryman., 2010; Gay, 2000; Ladson-Billings, 1995). The\ncommon theme in the literature that authentic cultural competence training must go\nbeyond short-term feel-good surface-learning approaches (Perso, 2012, pp. 56\u201362)\nbears out in this research study within and across the sites.\nThis programme also reinforces the importance of recognising and working within\nIndigenous knowledge systems where acknowledging and respecting the central role ofCRITICALSTUDIESINEDUCATION 485\ncultural knowledge holders is pivotal to learning. The results and ensuing discussion\nfurther reflect an understanding of these systems through supporting participant\nreflexivity, acknowledging the significance of the past, rejecting deficit discourses,\nacknowledgingAboriginalcultureasdynamicandadaptive,recognisingtheimportance\nof place- and relationships-based pedagogies, engaging with Aboriginal parents and\ncommunity members, acknowledging power relationships and highlighting the trans-\nformative potential of teacher critical consciousness. The deep learning that emerged\nthrough the CTC programme became increasingly evident in participant\u2019s articulations\nof their experiences.\nSupporting participant reflexivity\nThe CTC programme is an example of authentic and transformative cultural compe-\ntency training. Teacher responses to the CTC experience reinforce this through com-\nmentssuchas,\u2018ItwasthemostsignificantprofessionaldevelopmentIhaveexperienced\nin 10 years of teaching. It was highly significant in the depth of its content and in\nbuilding intercultural respect, confidence and understanding\u2019. Importantly, this senti-\nment was evident in many of the interviews we conducted and is reflected in Nicholls\u2019\n(2009) multilayered reflexivity around self, others and interrelationships. Reflexive\ntransparency where hidden assumptions are questioned became evident in growing\nparticipant awareness of the significance of the past to Aboriginal people, the impor-\ntance of rejecting deficit discourses and new understandings of the dynamic and\nadaptive nature of Aboriginal culture in their community. Participants\u2019 interpersonal\nreflexivity emerged when they began to make connections with Aboriginal parents and\nthe community through concepts such as place-based and relationships-based pedago-\ngies. This second layer required participants to consider and articulate their position-\nality so as to engage with the third layer, collective reflexivity. At this level of genuine\ncollaborative learningandpractice, the potentialforpersonal transformationleadingto\nsocial change can be seen as participants began to recognise and acknowledge the\nimpact of power relationships and what this means for engagement with Aboriginal\nstudents, parents and the community, as well as for the pedagogic enactment of\ncurriculum. An emerging collective reflexivity is evident in this teacher\u2019s response:\nWewerealllookingatissuestogether.Noonesidewasdominant,ithelpedusseewewere\nallfacingthisdifficultytogetherandwesharedinformationastruthfullyaspossible.There\nis definitely now a feeling of more acceptance.\nClearly, this level of engagement is in its infancy in terms of Nicholls (2009) reification\nof collective reflexivity, but within the context of tense Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal\nrelationships at many of the sites, it is significant and enlightening.\nThe significance of the past\nCentral to developing cultural responsiveness is acknowledging the significance of the\nAustralian colonial legacy of dispossession, oppression and marginalisation of\nAboriginal people (Phillips, 2011), as one community member notes, \u2018they need to be\naware that white Australia has a black history, talking about things that\u2019s real, that486 C.BURGESS\nhappened to us, a lot of them don\u2019t know the history of this valley, the massacres, that\nsort of thing\u2019. Community people believe that a deep understanding of this history is\nimportantknowledgefor teachersandwasnotedinteacherparticipantcommentssuch\nas, \u2018tellingstories wasdefinitely quiteprofound for alot ofusandhelped usrealise just\nhow raw that emotion still is for those people and how it has affected their life, so it\nmade it very real\u2019. Notably, this first-hand experiential approach to learning models a\npedagogical approach that many Aboriginal students relate to.\nRejecting deficit discourses\nRejectingdeficitdiscoursesaboutAboriginalpeoplesandtheculturalreductionismthat\naccompanies this is a key element in challenging neocolonial policies and practices in\nschools (Bishop & Berryman., 2010; Hattam, Brennan, Zipin, & Comber, 2009).\nCommunity members often highlighted the misunderstandings and misconceptions\nthat they believed teachers have about Aboriginal students: \u2018teachers don\u2019t understand\nthese kids, it\u2019s not that they\u2019re naughty it\u2019s just because they might be going through\nstress. When they tell a kid they\u2019re bad they just keep being bad \u2019cause they\u2019re getting\nattention\u2019. This assumption of \u2018naughtiness\u2019 is absorbed and enacted by the student,\ninadvertently reinforcing deficit positioning, resulting in low expectations and poor\noutcomes. The following comment demonstrates how a shift in a teacher\u2019s perception\nof a student changes their view and expectations of him: \u2018one of our kids is fairly\ndifficult but you get him on the didgeridoo. It blows you away and you realise; \u201cWell if\nthat\u2018s there what else is he doing that we have no idea about at school?\u201d\u2019\nAcknowledging Aboriginal culture as dynamic and adaptive\nIn understanding and enacting a high expectations approach for Aboriginal students,\nteachers acknowledge that Aboriginal culture is alive and adaptive, not static. This is\nparticularly relevant in urban areas where the stereotype of lost culture persists and is\nreflected in this teacher\u2019s surprise in experiencing the vibrancy of local Aboriginal\nculture.\nThe thing for me was seeing that Aboriginal culture is so alive and thriving, especially in\nour community in Redfern (inner city Sydney). To visit places like the congress, lands\ncouncilandtoseethatpeopleareworkingsohardandgoingtosuchlengthstobringthe\ncommunityoutintothebroaderAustralia.Ithinkthatwasreallypowerfulformebecause\nyou don\u2019t see it \u2013 this was a real eye-opener.\nThe teacher who understands the significance of this learning draws on Aboriginal\nstudents\u2019 funds of knowledge to embed their students\u2019 experiences into pedagogy and\ncurriculum (McInerney, 2009), resulting in confident Aboriginal people as well as\nconfident learners (NSW AECG & NSW DET, 2004). Yunkaporta (2009) suggests\nthat Aboriginal perspectives in the form of cultural content, \u2018not only develops\nIndigenousstudents\u2019prideintheirculture,butitallowsforculturalabilitiesandtalents\nto surface and be identified\u2019 (p. 16). This approach sees teaching and learning at the\ncentre of knowledge production rather than what is already codified in traditional\nresources. It is empowering because it challenges traditional interpretations of culturalCRITICALSTUDIESINEDUCATION 487\nand social capital (Hattam et al., 2009, p. 309) as one teacher notes, \u2018having those\ninsights of what is important to the local community, the significance of land features\nand the river, that comes through the kids, you know they talk about not being able to\neatthemulletoutoftheriver\u2019.Jov\u00e9s,Siqu\u00e9s,andEsteban-Guitart(2015)identifythisas\na \u2018funds of identity\u2019 approach that recognises historically accrued and culturally devel-\noped individual student geographical, social, cultural, institutional and practical posi-\ntionalities. Wrigley, Lingard, and Thomson (2012) further suggest that understanding\nand mobilising community-based, cultural and youth knowledges produces learning\nenvironments that are simultaneously grounded and critical.\nPlace-based and relationships-based pedagogies\nCrucial to enacting culturally responsive pedagogies is engaging with culturally appro-\npriate, innovative, place-based curriculum that reflects students\u2019 lived experiences\n(Gruenewald, 2008; Hattam et al., 2009; Yunkaporta, 2009). The current articulation\nof Indigenous ways of knowing, being and doing (Martin & Mirraboopa, 2003;\nYunkaporta, 2009) conceptualises an Indigenous approach to knowledge production\nandpracticeembeddedwithinaculturalandpersonalidentity.Thisapproachexplores,\nhonours, and problematises culture and heritage as interpreted through \u2018youth of\ncolour\u2019 (Paris & Alim, 2014, p. 86) rather than aspiring to white middle-class norms.\nFogarty(2010)suggeststhatforAboriginalstudents,apedagogicalframeworkisneeded\n\u2018toenabletheinclusionofIndigenousknowledgeinpedagogicdesignandaconnection\nbetween this knowledge and Indigenous development realities in remote communities\u2019\n(p. 218). This approach responds to demographic and social change as well as neo-\nliberal challenges to social justice and equity goals that invest in deficit policy and\nproblematise the \u2018Other\u2019 (Smyth, 2012). Culturally responsive pedagogy applies con-\ncepts such as heritage and community practices to reflect the past and present com-\nmunity dimensions that account for culture as dynamic, shifting and fluid. One\nteacher\u2019s efforts to embed local community knowledge and expertise into her teaching\ndemonstrates a growing sense of interpersonal reflexivity (Nicholls, 2009) which leads\nto collective engagement such as,\nBecauseofmakingconnectionsthroughConnectingtoCountry,IchattedwiththeLands\nCouncil Coordinator and told her that I was in the early stages of getting this girls well-\nbeingprogramtogetherbecauseshehasgotawomen\u2019sprogramrunning.SoIthoughtwe\ncould tie the girls\u2019 program in with the women\u2019s program so I\u2019d have those community\ncontacts and have the school working within their own community on a wider scale.\nThe real value of this is that student learning is embedded in a strong cultural identity\nconnected to country, culture and community. This level of engagement increases\ncapacity, confidence and resilience and is more likely to improve student academic,\ncultural and social outcomes.\nAboriginal parent and community engagement\nParent and community engagement is another important aspect of developing cultu-\nrally responsive teaching and learning practices. While mindful of the historical488 C.BURGESS\nsocioculturalissuesandcommittedtoacknowledgingtheseindailypractice(Burgess&\nCavanagh,2016;Harrison&Greenfield,2011),teachersneedtobuildrelationshipswith\nthe Aboriginal community to better engage students in their classroom. As one teacher\nnotes,\u2018whenyoucantalktokidsabouttheEldersthatyou\u2019vemetandaboutpeoplethat\nyouknowinthecommunity,thathelpskidstoknowthatthere\u2019sadialoguehappening,\nthereissomecontact\u2019.Whenstudentsrealisethattheirteacherknowsmembersoftheir\ncommunity, they feel that the teacher has an understanding of who they are as\nAboriginal people. Further, the opportunity for teachers to meet Aboriginal Elders,\nparents, serviceproviders, governmentemployeesandvolunteerswasacknowledgedby\nmany as improving the prospect for deeper connections at the community level, asone\nteacher explains;\nWe need to build those relationships, so that they (community members) will feel more\ncomfortable coming into our classrooms, because without that relationship, they\u2019re going\nto feel like an outsider. They need to feel like they have a strong connection with the\nteacher so that they feel confident that we\u2019re not going to let them down.\nThis teacher demonstrates an emerging understanding of Nicholls (2009) multi-\nlayered reflexivity by not only recognising the importance of Aboriginal commu-\nnity relationships but also in understanding the implications of the difficult\nhistorical relationship between schools and communities, and in a sense of perso-\nnal responsibility to redress this.\nAcknowledging power relationships\nAcknowledging the impact of discursive power relations between schools and commu-\nnities is an important step in developing meaningful, authentic and caring teacher\u2013\nstudent relationships (Bishop & Berryman., 2010; Burgess, 2016). Nicholls (2009)\nnotion of collective reflexivity is essential here if current tensions based on oppressive\nhistorical practices are not addressed. It is through the CTC programme that a rare\nwindow of opportunity opened up as noted by one teacher:\nWe heard some of the local people talking about being taken away from the Stolen\nGeneration and some of their stories and then how today they\u2019re still treated differently.\nIt\u2019s hard to get my head around that so much time has passed and they\u2019re still separate\nfrom us and it shouldn\u2019t be like that.\nThat localAboriginalcommunitiesthroughthe NSWAECGdesign anddeliverprofes-\nsional learning for their teachers is, in itself, a significant acknowledgment of power\nrelationshipsatthesystemiclevel.Itmodelsaredistributionofpoweressentialtoeasing\ntension between historically disparate groups, building equitable relationships between\nschools and communities and strengthening community social capital. Brough et al.\n(2006)suggestastrongcorrelationbetweenlevelsofeducationalachievementandlevels\nof social capital, that when perceived as \u2018community cultural wealth\u2019 (Yosso, 2005),\nbecomes a normalised presence in the professional learning arena, therefore advancing\nthe cultural capital of the whole community.CRITICALSTUDIESINEDUCATION 489\nTransformative potential of teacher critical consciousness\nThe development of genuine critical reflexivity of personal positioning is central\nhere and includes the development of a critical consciousness (Gay & Kirkland,\n2003; Kumagai & Lypson, 2009). Gay and Kirkland (2003) identify the notion of a\ncultural critical consciousness as one where, through the lens of race, ethnic diver-\nsity and social justice, teachers are \u2018self conscious, critical and analytical about one\u2019s\nown teaching beliefs and behaviours \u2026 and \u2026 what is to be taught, how, and to\nwhom\u2019 (p. 181). They suggest that subsequently, teachers need to develop the habits,\nskills and behaviours that embed criticalness and reflexivity into daily personal\nlearning, and teaching practice (p. 182) foreshadowing the development of a peda-\ngogical cultural identity. This teacher\u2019s response to being asked to reflect on her\ncultural background illuminates a starting point for developing critical\nconsciousness.\nInthesecondworkshopwetalkedaboutourownpersonalcultureandwhatthatmeansto\nusandno-one\u2019severaskedmewhatmyculturewas.Ihadtositthereandthinkwhat\u2019smy\nculture and then there were a few other questions we got asked that had us actually\nthinking about place, like where do we most feel connected to?\nHersurpriseatbeingaskedabouthersenseofplacehighlightsdifferentunderstandings\nof self as a cultural being, and suggests that Aboriginal people recognise a general lack\nofculturalliteracyinteachers.Thishasimportantimplicationsforcritiquingtheschool\nandclassroomcultureaswellasopeningupcommunicationchannelsbetweenteachers\nandstudents.ThiswasclearwhenanAboriginalpresenterexplainedAboriginalEnglish\nasadialectratherthananinferiorversionofEnglish.Theteacherremarks,\u2018previouslyI\nhad judged the Aboriginal kids for how they speak because it wasn\u2019t the same as the\nway I speak.

Another teacher notes that he was\n\u2018really deeply moved by one speaker in particular who had a huge effect on me on a\npersonal level\u2019 as the community member explained some of the difficulties Aboriginal\nstudents experience outside of school. For this teacher, the community speaker was,\n\u2018makingitreal,likeyou\u2019reseeingthisonadailybasis(and)thisfellowissittinginfront\nof you discussing this openly\u2019.\nLimitations of the programme and the research\nA limitation of the CTC programme is the small number of participants from each\nschool, generallyearlycareer and/or newlyappointed teachersand the principal.While\ntheir professional learning is important, it is unlikely to impact significantly on curri-\nculum, pedagogy and school structures unless the principal explicitly prioritises and\nactionstheseareas(Burgess&Cavanagh,2013).Onceteachersreturntoschool,thereis\nno systematic support or monitoring of their progress in implementing the knowledge\nand skills gained from their CTC experience and so it is often difficult for them to\nmaintain momentum beyond initial enthusiasm (Burgess & Cavanagh, 2016). If this\nprogramme does not sit within a framework of overall school structural and cultural\nchange, then its transformative potential is limited to largely individual efforts,490 C.BURGESS\ntherefore, contributing to a sense of ongoing disconnection that plagues education in\nthis area (Burgess & Cavanagh, 2013).\nFurther, as this study was conducted early in the implementation of the CTC\nprogramme (year 2 and 3), the findings are limited to short-term impacts. Ideally, a\nlongitudinal research study is needed to ascertain any significant and sustainable\nimpacts of the CTC programme (Burgess & Cavanagh, 2013) for teachers, Aboriginal\nstudents and school-community relationships.\nWhere to now?\nA significant implication from this study is that simplified short-term cultural\ncompetence training programmes are inadequate. Commonly applied descriptive\nlists gloss over deeper imperatives such as understanding the impact of colonisation\non Aboriginal people and the ongoing legacy this has on relationships between\nAboriginal and non-Aboriginal people and the state. These lists tend to reinforce\nhierarchies and maintain the status quo rather than engaging with the process of\ndecolonisation through challenging and disrupting power and privilege (Keddie,\n2012; McInerney, 2009). Certainly, the overall lack of attention to the social pro-\ncesses of learning means that significant skills such as relationship building, devel-\noping trust and reciprocity are ignored, thus ironically undermining claims of\ncompetence.\nEvidence from the CTC programme demonstrates the importance of addressing\nthese key issues through recognition of Aboriginal people as the experts in deciding\nwhat knowledge, understandings and skills teachers need to become culturally respon-\nsive practitioners. Privileging Indigenous ways of knowing, being and doing over\nwestern ways is a significant cultural and resource shift away from the state. This\nempowers local people to become genuine stakeholders in the education of their\nchildrenastheycaninfluencetheverypeoplewhospendmoretimewiththeirchildren\noutside the family than anyone else. Building relationships between families and\nteachers must therefore attract significant effort if we are to develop critically reflexive,\nculturally responsive teachers of Aboriginal children (Burgess & Evans, 2017). The real\nstrength of the CTC programme is in the development of new relationships between\npeople from historically and socially disparate groups and the power of these relation-\nships to transform education at the grass roots level (Kearney et al., 2014).\nThrough the CTC experience, teachers gain significant knowledge and confidence in\nworking with Aboriginal students, their families and communities to challenge the\ncolonising practices of education and the school. As such, they potentially become\nchange agents in their schools, advocating for reciprocal relationships and shared\nresponsibility while concurrently replacing deficit discourses with a dialogic framing\nofbelonging,connectionandengagement.Thispositivelyinfluencesschoolcultureand\ncreates an atmosphere conducive to collaborative success although as noted (Burgess &\nCavanagh, 2013).\nWhile the programme currently caters for teachers at schools with significant\nAboriginal populations, it is potentially transferable to school contexts with small\nAboriginal student numbers. This depends largely on financial resources and commit-\nment at the local school level. The programme\u2019s crucial role of engaging local schoolsCRITICALSTUDIESINEDUCATION 491\nwith local Aboriginal culture and community is important regardless of the number of\nAboriginal students enrolled as it supports the authenticity and integrity of the\nWelcome/Acknowledgement to Country protocol that most schools now include in\ntheir own protocols. Further, it is justifiable in terms of meeting departmental policy\naims (New South Wales Department of Education and Training, 2009), Australian\ncurriculum priorities (ACARA, 2011) and professional teaching standards (ATSIL,\n2014).\nOverall, the positive outcomes from the CTC programme provide a convincing\nargument for privileging this approach over current preoccupation with quantifiable\noutcomes demonstrated by limited accreditation regimes, which reflect only narrow\naccountsofteachingandlearning.Consequently,thisstudyhasfurtherimplicationsfor\nquality teaching such as prioritising culturally responsive relationships-based pedago-\ngical approaches through proactive engagement with the Aboriginal community and\ndevelopingteachercriticalculturalreflexivity(Nicholls,2009).Italsoindicatestheneed\nto invest in longitudinal studies to assess the role of quality teacher professional\nlearning in improving Aboriginal student outcomes.\nConclusion\nThis paper argues for the importance of problematising and challenging populist\ncultural competence training programmes that focus on the warm\u2013fuzzy aspects of\nculture while ignoring the more uncomfortable historical, sociocultural and political\nissuesthatcontinuetooppressAboriginalpeople(Pon,2009;Vass,2014).Itbringsinto\nfocus the underlying neo-liberal push for narrow, financially motivated accountability\nregimes that prioritise short-term box-ticking procedures and contributes to the \u2018tech-\nnicization of professional knowledge\u2019 (Connell, 2013, p. 99) over quality professional\nlearning.\nAs can be seen by the rich data revealed in the interviews, cultural competency is\nboth profoundly challenging and rewarding when delivered by local Aboriginal com-\nmunity experts who prioritise relationship building, experiential learning and personal\naccounts.Thispowerfulapproachembedsthelocalsocioculturalandpoliticallandscape\ninto teacher consciousness and so challenges the nature of Aboriginal and non-\nAboriginal relationships in educational contexts. As teachers critically reflect on their\npositioning andthinkabout howthis impactson theirteaching, theyare inmany cases\nliberated from the constraints of uncertainty and fear so often attached to teaching in\nthis area (Maxwell, 2012).\nGenuine cultural competency is a lifelong project that involves significant personal\nand professional commitment to reframing one\u2019s thinking from another\u2019s standpoint,\nand understanding the role of knowledge, knowledge ownership and knowledge pro-\nduction through the lens of power relationships. Mobilising critical reflexivity is\nimportant because this contributes enormously to developing relationships-based ped-\nagogies crucial to engaging Aboriginal students. The real power of this journey, how-\never, is the potentially positive impact on Aboriginal families and communities who\nbecame genuine partners in improving the educational outcomes of their children and\nin the process, enhancing social capital and community cultural wealth. The CTC492 C.BURGESS\nprogramme demonstrates that when power is with the genuine knowledge holders,\ntransformational change is more than just a possibility it can become a reality.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work is supported by the NSW Department of Education and Communities.\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the NSW Department of Education and Communities.\nNotes on contributor\nCathieBurgessisSeniorLecturerinEducationandAboriginalStudiesCurriculumattheFaculty\nof Education and Social Work, University of Sydney.

From this point onwards, parents/carers have a\nlegal responsibility to ensure their children attend school every day until they are 17 years old. As such, schools play an\nextremely influential role in the lives of young people. While education is compulsory, it is also seen as a human right,\nsupported by the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA, 2008). There is,\ntherefore, a distinct belief in schooling as benevolent, providing the necessary academic and social grounding to produce\nconfident, capable adults. But what if this was untrue for some? What if schools were actually sites of harm, trauma and\nwere potentially causing damage to students\u2019 self-belief?\n1\nFor decades, Aboriginal people have lobbied for input into the current imposed education system in Australia (Lowe,\n2017). With several policies requiring teachers to embed Indigenous perspectives and strategies into schools, it is an\nopportune moment for Aboriginal people to have substantial input into educational decisions (Bishop, Vass, & Thompson,\n2019). While this should represent a shift in the way Indigenous knowledges are recognised and valued, typically\nAboriginal knowledges are often considered peripheral or irrelevant in the school curriculum and so are often not\nadequately represented (Lowe & Yunkaporta, 2013). Coupled with the frustration many Indigenous people feel towards the\nassimilatory effects of the education system (Vass, 2015), this has prompted increased insistence that Aboriginal people\nshould have input into educational decisions for the benefit of Aboriginal students, and indeed all students.\nThis paper discusses an Aboriginal cultural mentoring programme that followed a three-day cultural immersion\nexperience \u2013 Connecting to Country (CTC) \u2013 conducted by the Inner City Local Aboriginal Education Consultative Group\n(AECG). This Aboriginal-led project has achieved notable success across New South Wales (NSW) (Burgess & Cavanagh,\n2016). It is significant in the challenge it presents to dominant social norms and Western knowledge systems. First, wecontextualise the cultural mentoring project within the broader field of Culturally Responsive Schooling (CRS) before\noutlining Moodie\u2019s (2018) \u2018Decolonising Race Theory\u2019 (DRT) as the theoretical framework applied for analysis. This\ncritical theoretical approach reveals both visible and invisible effects of normative discourses about Aboriginal peoples and\ncultures, and their interaction with schooling systems. Arguably, despite the best intentions of teachers, these social norms\npermeate school culture and alienate Aboriginal students.\nBy applying Moodie\u2019s (2018) DRT framework, we analyse Aboriginal cultural mentor and teacher mentee interviews to\nunpack perceptions of the Aboriginal assertion of sovereignty and futurity as a way in which to understand what\ndecolonising education might mean in this context. We then discuss implications arising from this analysis that reveal\nsignificant structural changes needed for a more equitable education system that acknowledges the sovereignty of\nIndigenous people in Australia.\nSituating cultural mentoring within culturally responsive schooling (CRS)\nGlobally, culturally responsive schooling (CRS) identifies a framework to disrupt western hegemonic power and re-centre\npower-sharing between student and teacher (Paris & Alim, 2017). Gay (2002) asserts that culturally responsive pedagogy\nuses the \u2018cultural characteristics, experiences, and perspectives of ethnically diverse students as conduits for teaching them\nmore effectively\u2019 (p. 106), so that students are seen as knowledge holders, rather than passive recipients. Paris and Alim\u2019s\n(2014) \u2018culturally sustaining\u2019 pedagogy, where linguistic and cultural pluralism is at the heart of \u2018positive social\ntransformation\u2019 (p. 1) extends the culturally responsive framework. Meanwhile, Hobson, Lowe, Poetsch, and Walsh (2010)\nargue for the genuine inclusion of Indigenous languages and cultural knowledge as an enactment of tribal sovereignty to\nchallenge the assimilationist impact of education.\nHowever, teachers are often unaware as to how they can meaningfully incorporate a culturally sustaining approach into\ntheir everyday teaching practices (Burgess & Evans, 2017). While education policy in Australia has focused on quality\nteaching to improve educational outcomes, the persistence of poor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander educational\noutcomes continues (Bodkin-Andrews & Carlson, 2014; Gillan, Mellor, & Krakouer, 2017) despite numerous strategies and\ninitiatives to alleviate these. Literacy and numeracy strategies are often perceived to be the panacea for improving\nAboriginal educational outcomes but given that these have not \u2018closed the gap\u2019, high-quality teaching for Aboriginal\nstudents\u2019 needs to move beyond these approaches (Burgess & Lowe, 2019). For example, CRS shows the importance of\nteachers building relationships to support (Aboriginal) students\u2019 cultural identities; understanding (Aboriginal) students\u2019\nsocio-cultural and historical contexts; and utilising quality teaching in a culture of high expectations (Burgess & Evans,\n2\n2017; Buxton, 2017). Using these understandings and practices is more powerful when the site of learning is \u2018on Country\u2019.\nTeacher professional learning delivered by Aboriginal cultural educators on Country has increasingly been recognised as\na powerful and empowering approach for teachers and community members alike (Harrison, Page, & Tobin, 2016;\nYunkaporta & McGinty, 2009). In particular, teachers report increased confidence in building relationships with Aboriginal\nstudents and families; engaging with the local Aboriginal community; and more effectively embedding Aboriginal\nperspectives into their curriculum and pedagogy (Burgess & Cavanagh, 2016). Following their involvement in the CTC\nprogramme, teachers reported frustration upon returning to school as they have little time to fully reflect on and enact their\nlearnings in any meaningful way. Consequently, an Aboriginal-led cultural mentoring pilot project was implemented to\nassess whether to follow up support delivered by Aboriginal cultural mentors in addressing these issues.\nThis Aboriginal cultural mentoring project took place in two urban schools in inner-city Sydney over eight weeks (two\nhours per week). This approach supported teachers\u2019 learning by reinforcing the importance of providing opportunities for\ntheir students to engage with Aboriginal cultural knowledge and to acknowledge Aboriginal cultural mentors as educators\nand role models in their communities and schools. Local Aboriginal Education Workers (variations of this title exist across\njurisdictions) have been employed in some schools since the 1950s to support teachers in implementing culturally\nappropriate content (MacGill, 2017) but their work is often not recognised and/or is invisible. Decolonising Race Theory\n(Moodie, 2018) makes visible these knowledge and skills as embedded in sovereign owners of place highlighting context-\nspecific, localised and diverse understandings of Indigenous peoples, cultures and histories, rather than simply as theracialised \u2018other\u2019, thus challenging the veracity of \u2018approved\u2019 knowledge from education department \u2018experts\u2019 (Lowe &\nYunkaporta, 2013).\nUsing Decolonising Race Theory in educational research\nDecolonising Race Theory (DRT) is a theoretical framework that is pertinent to the specific legal and socio-historical\ncircumstances in the Australian settler-colonial context and is distinct from other critical theories (such as Critical Race\nTheory) in centring Indigenous futurities, place and relationality in place (Moodie, 2018). While decolonisation is a\nproblematic term (Tuck & Yang, 2012), it is important to build on key theoretical work (c/f, Freire, 2000; Said, 1978;\nSmith, 2012) to re-think these debates in terms of material effects, return of sovereign lands back to First Nations peoples\nand decolonising epistemes in and through the curriculum and research.\nIn this context, Critical Race Theory (CRT) seeks to challenge dominant ideologies that contribute to racial\ndiscrimination and the (re)production of inequality (Solorzano, 1997) and critics argue that without modification, CRT is\nineffective when applied to Indigenous contexts (Denzin & Lincoln, 2008) as it tends to \u2018other\u2019 through racial theorising\n(Moodie, 2018, p. 36). This understates the role of culture, inherent connection and obligation to Country and positioning as\n\u2018colonised\u2019 which are prioritised by Indigenous Australian scholars. In an attempt to refine CRT to address the experiences\nof Native Americans, Brayboy (2005) provides nine tenets in his development of Tribal Critical Race Theory (TribalCrit).\nHis emphasis on colonisation draws attention to the ongoing imperial project of assimilating/ eliminating Indigenous\nPeoples through government and educational policies. While there may be similarities in the treatment of US Indigenous\nPeoples and other settler-states, caution is advised when importing frameworks from one context to another in terms of the\nsignificance of place, presence or absence of treaty(s) and specificity of experience to Indigenous peoples.\nThe need for an Australian oriented CRT was identified by Vass in 2015 and developed by Moodie in 2018. In drawing\non the work of Grande (2000), Moodie (2018) contends that CRT doesn\u2019t centre issues of sovereignty and self-\ndetermination and is consequently limited in \u2018recognising the ontological diversity and the place-based and sovereign\nclaims of Indigenous peoples\u2019 (p. 36). In response, DRT focuses on First Peoples as sovereign beings, rather than racialised\nbeings. While noting that Aboriginal people like other groups are often identified as occupying a racialised positioning,\nBodkin-Andrews and Carlson (2014) note that this reflects a history of representation that often focuses on racial\nstereotypes and cultural essentialism. As Moodie (2018) notes, \u2018the methodological and theoretical contribution of\nDecolonising Race Theory allows centring of Indigenous difference and the disruption of knowledge\u2013power dialectic which\nperpetuates deficit discourses\u2019 (p. 43) highlighting the structures of oppression rather than individual positioning within\nthese. Importantly, DRT places primacy on Indigenous sovereignty, futurity and notions of place, drawing together and\nbuilding upon the work of Indigenous warrior scholarship (c/f, Martin, 2003; Moreton-Robinson, 2015; Nakata, 2007).\nDRT consists of seven tenets (Moodie, 2018, pp. 38\u201342) which are outlined as follows:\nLogic of elimination\nDrawing on Wolfe (2006), Moodie (2018) asserts the \u2018logic of elimination serves to describe the processes of erasure that\ncolonial education systems have served\u2019 (p. 39). Attempts to eliminate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\nincluded physical acts of genocide as well as political and legal acts of colonisation such as assimilation. Unfortunately, this\nlegacy continues in the form of government and educational policies, and so Aboriginal people remain perceived to be a\nproblem to be \u2018fixed\u2019. The assimilationist intent of schooling continues the logic of elimination in that this suggests that if\nIndigenous people conform to Western values, they will provide minimal resistance to land theft and exploitation.\nIndigeneity as a political tool for justice\nTransnational solidarity is growing amongst Indigenous groups in response to the race discourses which define and\ncategorise Indigeneity as subordinate. This reinforces whiteness and has resulted in increased resistance towards attempts to\nlimit constructions of Aboriginality. This global activism is reconstructing the \u2018raced\u2019 category of Indigeneity as a politicaltool for justice; seeking and celebrating \u2018differences and commonalities across Indigenous communities\u2019 (Moodie, 2018, p.\n39).\nSovereignty and Indigenous futurity\nThis tenet recognises Indigenous peoples\u2019 autonomous right to develop their/our own policies regarding self-determination,\nidentification, land use and sovereign relations. Intimately linked to the recognition of land ownership and occupation,\nIndigenous futurity thus \u2018requires a rejection of settler epistemologies and a recognition of the possibilities of land-based\npedagogies for reconnection, disruption and invention\u2019 (Moodie, 2018, p. 40).\nCultural interface\nDrawing on Nakata\u2019s (2007) work, the cultural interface tenet requires Indigenous futurity to function with recognition of\nthe complexities of Indigenous identities, rather than seeing to define Indigenous ways of knowing and being. Thus, the\ncultural interface \u2018describes the position from which we interrogate the complexities of power and resist imposed\npositioning\u2019 (Moodie, 2018, p. 40). Here, Indigenous standpoints provide a position from which to analyse knowledge\nproduction and challenge representation.\nRelationality and collectivism\nMartin (2003) and Rowse\u2019s (2009) work highlights the diversity of Indigenous peoples, knowledges and life worlds.\nIndigenous people sustain complex relationships between people and Country (Martin, 2003), with emphasis placed on\ncommunity obligations (Rowse, 2009). This work does not seek to \u2018deny hybridity or reify racial categories\u2019 (Moodie,\n2018, p. 41), but rather enacts a refusal to engage in binary logics or contradictory discourses. Understanding relationality\nforegrounds collectivism over individualism and acknowledges the fluidity and adaptive nature of cultural identity and\nexpression.\nIndigenous methodologies\nStorytelling as methodology, and story-as-theory, serves an important purpose in disrupting and rejecting positivism. The\nemerging diversity of Indigenous methodologies offers complex ways to justify and share Indigenous knowledges that\nreach beyond storytelling. Smith (2012) presents a number of methodologically diverse projects which \u2018centre Indigenous\npeople\u2019s aims of self-determination and healing\u2019 (Moodie, 2018, p. 41).\nReparative activism\nMuch Indigenous research is inherently political, emboldened by an imperative to disrupt colonial powers and support\nIndigenous self-determination. It is therefore generative and reparative in its intent and, unlike Western research\nepistemologies, values process over the outcome; developing from \u2018critique to include a theory of change\u2019 (Moodie, 2018,\np. 42). Consequently, ongoing support is necessary for Indigenous scholars to navigate the demands of the academy and\nassert/justify Indigenous knowledges.\nThis critical theoretical framework centres Indigenous diversity interrupts deficit discourses and works to detach\nwhiteness from the centre. Furthermore, the seven tenets of DRT can be used to theorise projects in a way which \u2018moves\nbeyond critique to consider the implications of the spiritual, political, economic, and academic projects of Indigenous\npeoples\u2019 (Moodie, 2018, p. 42). By moving from a focus on race to the role of sovereignty, political activism and\nIndigenous futurity, a DRT analysis reveals multiple, multifaceted and, at times, divergent Indigenous experiences to\narticulate deeper and nuanced socio-cultural, historical and political perspectives in a local context that challenge settler-\nnarratives of place.\nMethodologyCentral to Indigenous methodologies is privileging Indigenous voices (Bessarab & Ng\u2019andu, 2010; Martin, 2003; Rigney,\n1999; Smith, 2012) to provide opportunities for deep engagement with Aboriginal ways of knowing, being and doing. Also\ncentral to DRT, this methodological approach employs yarning and storytelling (Bessarab & Ng\u2019andu, 2010; Laycock,\nWalker, Harrison, & Brands, 2011; Walker, Fredericks, Mills, & Anderson, 2014) as a focus for data collection as it \u2018centres\nplace and relationality of place as core concepts in Indigenous education research\u2019 (Moodie, 2018, p. 38).\nIndividual yarns through Aboriginal mentor interviews (N = 4) and teacher mentee interviews (N = 4), encouraged open,\nhonest and self-reflective responses. A collaborative yarn with six teacher mentees revealed diverse and unique\nunderstandings and perceptions of the AECG CTC programme and the cultural mentoring project through experiencing\nlocal Aboriginal peoples\u2019 deep relationship to place. Moodie\u2019s DRT provides an emancipatory theoretical lens because it is\nrefocused from \u2018race\u2019 to Aboriginal concerns for sovereignty, self-determination and pursuing a social justice agenda, which\nwere reflected in many mentee\u2019s experiences in the project.\nThe study was conducted in a well-known, socially and politically active community where the urban setting shapes the\nnature of learning in Country. Early career and/or newly appointed teachers were selected for the CTC and cultural\nmentoring project, and the mentoring relationship and process developed organically and collaboratively between mentors\nand mentees. The emerging, dialogical nature of these relationships resulted in inclusive approaches where the mentees,\nmentors and their students all played an active role in re-storying place in their learning.\nFindings\nAnalysing the cultural mentoring project through Moodie\u2019s (2018) DRT revealed that teacher mentees focused on the role\nand context of Indigenous rights as they experienced the strong sense of culture, identity, ownership and political activism\ndemonstrated by the Aboriginal cultural mentors. Further supporting this was the relational rather than managerial focus of\nteacher-mentor interaction, driven by the common purpose of better engaging Aboriginal students and their families in the\neducation process as well as recognising the significant systemic challenges to be addressed when working towards\ndecolonising education.\nMoodie\u2019s logic of elimination is often reflected in Aboriginal community frustrations about the lack of accurate, reliable\nand in-depth curriculum content from an Aboriginal perspective, as one mentor notes:\nIt\u2019s a problem for the education system \u2026 it says we should have cultural perspectives and content and inclusion, but if that\u2019s the\ncase why don\u2019t we have designated courses, not just for Aboriginal kids but for non-Aboriginal kids.\nThis attempted suppression of Aboriginal knowledges is addressed in this mentoring project as it acknowledges Aboriginal\npeople\u2019s expertise and right to articulate their knowledges as they see fit by positioning them as cultural mentors of\nteachers. This is expressed through personal narratives such as the following mentor\u2019s explanation to the teacher and class\nabout identity:\nIt\u2019s growing up your family, your identity, your song line, your storyline, who you come from, where you come from, what\nconnection to the land do you have? What is spirituality about?\nOpportunities to articulate diverse, fluid and collective identities are crucial to asserting sovereignty and participating in\nreparative activism in order to advocate for Indigenous futurity. Mentees developed a more in-depth understanding about\nAboriginal peoples, cultures and histories and pushed back against essentialised pan-Aboriginality stereotypes that limit and\ndehumanise.\n\u2018Indigeneity as a political tool for justice\u2019 (Moodie, 2018) has a transnational and local focus, and this project highlights\nthe considerable impact of the local level approach in breaking down misconceptions, misunderstandings and\nmisrepresentations of Indigeneity. This mentor highlights the importance of understanding diversity through local\norientations:\nMy learning is completely different to somebody else\u2019s learning and that depends on what you want and how you want it to be\ndelivered to them. So, there\u2019s all these different pedagogies and how to do them, but mine is based around what I know and whatI\u2019ve learnt on culture.\nAs mentors draw on their Indigeneity to educate, empower and articulate their collective rights; discussions, understandings\nand relationships move beyond categories of \u2018race\u2019 to focus on culture and community. One mentor suggests that this\ncollaborative approach to mentoring builds relationships with the \u2018other\u2019:\nIt\u2019s an honour to be asked to mentor because it assumes you have some knowledges and experiences and I think mentoring's a\ntwo-way process \u2026 in terms of learning about their skills, their backgrounds and their knowledges.\nHere, political empowerment through reciprocity speaks back to the hierarchies that dominate Western education.\nThe lack of acknowledgement of Indigenous sovereignty in broader society as well as its absence from the current\nAustralian curriculum (Harrison et al., 2019; Lowe & Yunkaporta, 2013) is of crucial concern to Aboriginal people. Cultural\nmentoring provided Aboriginal people with the opportunity to assert their unique relationship to land, reinforcing their\nsense of sovereignty and disrupting colonial notions of Aboriginal peoples and cultures, as these teachers note:\nThere\u2019s culture right here in the city \u2026 mainstream society doesn\u2019t realise, but it\u2019s really important to these kids, even if they\ndon\u2019t come from here, the fact that they live here makes it really important\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019m not from this area and for me to find out how\nmuch Aboriginal culture is here was eye-opening \u2018cause I thought it was all in rural areas.\nTeacher understanding of the continual presence of a living, adaptive Aboriginal culture is central to recognising and\nsupporting self-determination and Indigenous futurity. This includes providing positive experiences that reaffirm Aboriginal\nstudent identity, as one teacher notes:\nThen we took some of his [cultural mentor] ideas and started down here in the garden and created a NSW map of the Aboriginal\nlanguage groups where the students could show where they came from.\nAs teachers develop deeper knowledge and understanding of local Aboriginal cultures and mobilise this in the classroom,\nconnections are made between the significance of sovereignty, self-determination and autonomy, and Aboriginal student\nengagement, well-being and achievement at school. The DRT framework is an effective analytical tool here as it makes\nvisible teacher mentee understandings of sovereignty and the critical role this plays in teaching and learning.\nMoodie (2018) suggests that Nakata\u2019s (2007) cultural interface theory provides a position from which to analyse\nknowledge production, the complexities of power and resist imposed positioning. In the cultural mentoring programme,\nexpertise was repositioned from Western to Indigenous traditions, thus challenging power relationships within Eurocentric\neducational structures. The importance of positioning Aboriginal cultural mentors as \u2018knowers\u2019 is noted by one of the\nteachers in the programme when she says:\nSo they\u2019re (the students) witnessing that relationship and developing theirs with her (the mentor) \u2026 witnessing an Aboriginal\nperson as an expert \u2026 \u2018cause it\u2019s too often the other way around.\nThis contributes to creating new and/or revised ways of thinking such as challenging and counteracting Western knowledge\nas one mentor explains:\nI\u2019ve developed something I call \u2018Learning Waterways\u2019 to make it more meaningful and contextual for them out there, broken it\ndown into seven topics but those topics are connected to the syllabus. It\u2019s just a subtle way of doing it.\nThis counter-hegemonic approach challenges Western epistemological and ontological understandings of curriculum and\npedagogy.\nThrough Nakata\u2019s (2007) locale (or positioning) of the learner, their agency (or perceived lack of) and the tension that\ncan exist between Western and non-western knowledges, a deeper understanding of the interaction between cultural groups\nemerges. The following comment by a teacher highlights this:I went to a high school where they prided themselves on being Aboriginal \u2026 but it manifested more as the Aboriginal kids getting\nto use the phone in the office when no-one else was allowed to \u2026 there was quite a bit of resentment about kids getting special\ntreatment \u2026 (but) now I see why and I can see the fairness of it.\nHere, the teacher notes how her locale as a student with little understanding of her Aboriginal peers, undermined her agency\nand created tension between the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal students. The cultural mentoring experience opened up\nspace for this teacher to deconstruct her experiences to build new levels of understanding in her own teaching.\nOne of the critical learnings noted by teachers is evident in Moodie\u2019s (2018) relationality and collectivism tenet through\nan emerging understanding of the centrality of relationships between Aboriginal peoples, knowledges and Country.\nListening to the Aboriginal cultural mentors and students discuss these relationships highlights how limited Western\neducation is in supporting Aboriginal student cultural learning:\nThis is how we know our songlines \u2026 There was a young girl, and when they told me her family, who they were, the family\nconnection in the name, she said my father\u2019s Aboriginal, but I\u2019ve never met him. So, she\u2019s asked her mother where her dad was\nfrom, and then I connected the two families and linked the Wiradjuri Nation to where she is now. Then I said to her this is where\nyour family has come from, down through those storylines and what people have told us where families were connected from, so\nyou have a land and a family.\nThe dialogic nature of the mentoring experiences supported this understanding of relationality as connections between\nmentors, teachers and the broader Aboriginal community developed through listening, yarning and collective experiences.\nAs one mentor explains: \u2018That\u2019s the connectedness to it so that it makes it real, relevant and reconnects it all up so that there\nis still some sort of balance to it all.\u2019 Another mentor highlights the importance of reciprocity when building relationships:\nMore than being the authority figure towards them, if you\u2019re building the relationship up to try and get there with them, then you\nknow you\u2019ve got some rapport and you\u2019re building that ground with them.\nThis sense of power-sharing through respectful relationships was evident in the collaborative projects developed by\nmentors, mentees and their students that were enacted in the classroom.\nThe notion of reparative activism as an opportunity to decolonise through disrupting Western power is noted by an\nAboriginal cultural mentor:\nYou\u2019re constantly up against ignorance and disrespect for Aboriginal people, culture \u2026 we need to start looking at these kind of\nprograms \u2026 this is how excited I am about what you are actually doing.\nThe development and mobilisation of genuine relationships between schools and communities supporting cultural safety,\nagency and co-construction of knowledge, mobilises political action that decentres Western knowledges as superior. This\nwas noted by a mentor: \u2018I think the fact that we had a project to do together that kind of made it \u2026 I had a vision as to see\nwhere it could actually go, and I think that was important for both of us.\u2019 Moreover, this project affirms and empowers\nAboriginal student identity as family and community knowledges and skills are privileged and centred in curriculum and\npedagogy. One teacher connects this with the importance of activism through community voice:\nIt was new and inspiring experience that demonstrated the value of the Aboriginal \u2013 land relationship and local Aboriginal\npeoples\u2019 commitment to and persistence in fighting for their rights \u2026 to see that people are working so hard and going to such\nlengths to have a voice and bring the community out into broader Australia \u2026 was powerful for me.\nEmploying DRT as an analytical tool reveals how the CTC and cultural mentoring project deepens teacher understanding of\nthe effects of colonisation on Aboriginal communities, families and therefore on the Aboriginal students they teach. For\nmany teachers, it made the invisible, visible and forged a path for deeper understanding, respect and collaborative action.\nDiscussionAnalysis through Moodie\u2019s (2018) DRT framework disrupts colonial hegemonic (re)production of knowledge by focusing\nAboriginal cultural mentors\u2019 and teacher mentees\u2019 attention on concepts central to the framework such sovereignty,\nIndigenous futurity, self-determination, reparative activism and Country-centred relationality. The cultural mentoring\nproject created space for Aboriginal voices, knowledges and perspectives and embedding Indigenous knowledges, stories\nand skills in the classroom, offering teachers and students the opportunity to engage with multiple and complex knowledge\nsystems. For teachers, this highlighted the invisibility of Western knowledge systems that often obliterate Indigenous\nepistemologies and reinforce white privilege and the deleterious effects of colonial knowledge and structures (Bodkin-\nAndrews & Carlson, 2014). Moreover, the project opened up ways in which these effects could be counteracted by centring\nIndigenous knowledges and building on notions of relationality and collectivism through engaging with Aboriginal\ncommunity educators as cultural mentors. This builds teacher capacity to develop the knowledge and skills required to\ndisrupt Western knowledge hierarchies and challenge notions of whiteness as authority/expert. Indigenous knowledges\nbecame recognised as foundational for building classroom curriculum and Indigenous methodologies as a key to culturally\nresponsive teaching.\nThroughout the project, non-Aboriginal teachers became increasingly aware of the ignorance and disrespect often\ndirected towards Indigenous peoples, including the misconception that Aboriginal culture only exists in rural and remote\nareas, which in turn, strengthened their commitment to improve their own teaching. Challenging and addressing deficit\ndiscourses became part of the commitment to improving educational discourses about Aboriginal students and their\nfamilies, providing an excellent example of the reconciling impact of creating new knowledge at the interface between\nAboriginal and colonial knowledge systems (Yunkaporta & McGinty, 2009).\nTeachers came to appreciate the diversity of Aboriginal knowledges and skills, in particular narrative and dialogic\napproaches such as storytelling, observing and collaborative action that reinforced the relationality, connectivity and holistic\nnature of teaching/learning in this area. An understanding of the interconnectedness of people, place and knowledge\ndeveloped as teachers grew to appreciate the importance of building and sustaining relationships with community, Country\nand students. Cultural mentoring presents a pathway for schools and teachers to genuinely engage with local Indigenous\nknowledges and demonstrates the benefits to all. Through the DRT lens, this project challenges the colonial legacies that\npersist in Australia\u2019s education system and reveals a pathway for non-Indigenous people to envisage working in and\ncontributing to this space.\nIt is essential to note the limitations of the project, such as the short timeframe and a small number of participants, limits\nthe breadth rather than the depth of findings. This affected the potential impact of the project, noted by the teachers who\nreported wanting more ongoing support to habitually embed the new knowledge and skills into their everyday practice.\nSignificantly this approach shouldn\u2019t be just about attitudinal shifts, but deeper behavioural and cognitive change and a\nwhole system commitment to cultural change in schools and the institutions that support them.\nImplications\nThe implications reveal key systemic challenges if any shift in Indigenous students\u2019 educational, cultural and social\noutcomes is to occur. These are perhaps best articulated through the questions raised in the DRT analysis as follows:\n\u2022 How can local Indigenous knowledges and contexts be prioritised and privileged in increasingly centralised,\ngeneralised and universalised educational structures?\n\u2022 How can valuable professional learning outcomes that acknowledge the critical role of sovereignty and self-\ndetermination in improving Aboriginal student outcomes, be accounted for within current management architectures?\n\u2022 When will space and commitment for listening to, valuing and learning from Aboriginal voices which foreground\nrelationality and collectivism be made, to move beyond decision making and empowerment to agenda-setting and\nownership?\n\u2022 How can Aboriginal communities and their schools and teachers push back against the institutional racism and\nexclusion that thrives and/or re-invents itself when challenged?\u2022 What does \u2018success\u2019 look like for Aboriginal students beyond the material value of employment, and how can this be\noperationalised in a highly prescribed, centralised and monitored system?\n\u2022 How can social justice outcomes, as featured in the Melbourne Declaration (MCEETYA, 2008) be genuinely achieved\nfor Aboriginal students if there is no recognition of First Nation sovereignty and status?\n\u2022 What does culturally responsive schooling look like in the Australian context, or is there a more appropriate, local\narticulation that addresses the questions posed here?\nConclusion\nEvident in this project is the value of local Aboriginal-led cultural education for teachers that centres Country as teacher and\ncurriculum and involves students in the teaching and learning process (Harrison et al., 2016). Opportunities for two-way\nlearning based on trusting and respectful relationships foreshadowed reciprocal and collaborative communities of practice\n(Wenger, 2000) aimed at improving the educational, social and cultural outcomes for Aboriginal students. Founded on a\nstrength-based approach, this project invokes culturally responsive schooling principles by acknowledging Aboriginal\ncultural educators as experts and mobilising community cultural wealth (Yosso, 2005), thus challenging deficit discourses\nand \u2018outing\u2019 the deleterious effects of settler colonialism on Indigenous peoples. Analysis of mentors\u2019 and mentees\u2019\nexperiences and perceptions of the cultural mentoring project, using the DRT framework, provided new opportunities to\nlook beyond critical race theory to consider a deeper understanding and appreciation of the central role of sovereignty,\nreparative activism and Indigenous futurity (, 2018). This emerged quite clearly here, where Aboriginal people were\nteaching the teachers and connections to Country, place and land rights were central to the narrative. Acknowledging\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples as sovereign custodians of Country, the DRT framework reveals decolonising\npossibilities that may well emerge through grass-roots movements if opportunities to challenge systemic prejudices and\nexclusions are mobilised.\nAt this point, placing Indigenous voices front, centre and as the foundation of teaching and learning creates a context for\ndecolonisation to occur, if those voices are recognised, remunerated and respected. While the matter of recognition is\noccurring; albeit recent and slow; the matter of remuneration is not occurring as fully as required and the issue of respect\nstill remains problematic. Therefore, a significant commitment to embedding human and financial resources into\ninstitutional structures is necessary but not likely in the current climate of government budget cuts and obsession with\nexternal standardised measurements of success as the only story in education worth telling and funding. The potential of\nlocalised projects is in creating a groundswell movement that infiltrates the systems and shifts perspectives irrevocably;\nensuring future generations of Aboriginal students are not forced to endure schools as sites of harm and trauma, but rather\nexperience equitable educational, social and cultural outcomes as sovereign people of this Country we now call Australia.\nNotes\n1.

the\nLearning from Country\nFramework to build an Aboriginal\ncurriculum narrative for students\n29 July 2024 Issue: Semester 1 2024 Category: For your Research\nCathie Burgess and Katrina Thorpe share the processes and results of a five-year\nteaching and research project to support all teachers to develop an Aboriginal\ncurriculum narrative using a framework based on building relationships and listening\nto Aboriginal people and Country. . .\nAs Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal authors, we are two members of a team of four researchers who undertook a\nfive-year teaching and research project we called Learning from Country in the City (LFC) (Burgess, et al., 2022a).\nThis project emerged from an ongoing commitment to Aboriginal[1] education and Aboriginal Studies along with\nour personal and professional engagement in local Aboriginal community contexts. The project was undertaken\nwith preservice teachers, early-career teachers, and Aboriginal community-based educators[2] from 2018-2022\nat the University of Sydney, situated on Gadigal Land of the Eora Nation (now referred to as Sydney). We\nrecognise the many Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal educators before us who have worked tirelessly to ensure that\nAboriginal voices are foregrounded, and knowledges are embedded in Australia education systems (Holt, 2021).\nWe continue to support these goals by working with preservice teachers to develop their capability to\nmeaningful engage with local Aboriginal communities and move beyond surface-level and tokenistic approaches\nto the inclusion of Aboriginal curriculum content and pedagogies in their classrooms.\nSKNIL\nKCIUQ\n\uf179In our teaching, Learning from Country involves immersive learning experiences outside the classroom on\nCountry. Here, preservice teachers walk with Aboriginal community-based educators while listening to, learning\nfrom, and observing the layered stories of local Country.\nIn this article we share our insights to the significance of connecting preservice teachers, teachers, and students\nto Country-centred learning. A Learning from Country Framework is used to represent the key processes of\nengagement and learning, which shi\u0000s the focus of Aboriginal curriculum planning and implementation from\nthinking about what \u201cAboriginal content\u201d we might \u201cadd\u201d to the curriculum (although this can be one outcome of\nLFC) to foregrounding the ethical practices and processes that you can undertake to open up opportunities for\nbuilding connections to local Country and Aboriginal people.\nFirstly though, we must acknowledge that learning from/on/with Country is not new and, indeed, has been\npractised in Australia for thousands of years. The expanding literature that centres Country and Aboriginal\nknowledges in curriculum is a testament to the continuity, resilience and significance of these pedagogical\npractices for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal students and teachers in Australia now and in the future (e.g.,\nBurgess et al., 2022a, 2022b; Country et al, 2020; Dolan et al, 2020; Harrison, 2013; Lowe et al. 2021; McKnight,\n2016; Spillman et al., 2023; Thorpe, et al., 2021).\nWhat does the research in Aboriginal education tell us?\nIn 2019, 13 academics, from across ten universities, conducted ten systematic reviews analysing over 13,000\nresearch studies reported on from 2006 to 2017 (Guenther et al., 2019). These reviews covered key Indigenous\nEducation topics in the areas of curriculum, pedagogy, leadership, professional learning, racism, literacy,\nnumeracy, language and culture, community engagement, and remote education. Key findings across the\nreviews found that successful schools did the following:\nengage honestly and respectfully with parents and community.\ndemonstrate deep understanding of the local socio-cultural and political context resulting from\ncolonisation.\nfocus on holistic, wrap \u2013 around and culturally responsive strategies to support student, family, and\ncommunity needs.\narticulate high expectations of students, teachers, and leaders.\nensure curriculum, pedagogy and assessment reflects students\u02bc cultural backgrounds and interests, and\nis clearly sca\u0000olded and supported.\nimplement culture and language programs to deepen students\u02bc sense of belonging to build confident,\nengaged learners.\nAcknowledging yet overcoming the challenges of doing this\nwork\nSKNIL\nKCIUQ\n\uf179Many educators are challenged by working in this area for many reasons (Captain & Burgess, 2022). Significantly,\nteachers themselves have o\u0000en had little or no education on Aboriginal Australia and feel vulnerable and\nunprepared. Not wishing to o\u0000end Aboriginal students and their families (Rose, 2015), and overwhelmed by a\nconstantly growing and changing curriculum, teachers o\u0000en avoid this area unless it is mandatory.\nCompounding this inertia, the Aboriginal content in the Australian Curriculum is limited and while the NSW\ncurriculum improves on this, there is still no coherent, scoped and sequenced Aboriginal curriculum narrative\nacross the Key Learning Areas and Stages, as there is in \u2018mainstream\u02bc subjects. We suggest an Aboriginal\ncurriculum narrative is \u201ca combination and construction of the stories that teachers know (and have probably\nexperienced) about a particular subject or content area that provides knowledge, understandings, and therefore\nguidance about how and what to teach\u201d (Burgess et al., 2022b, p. 158). This can result in teachers wondering how\nto start to build this narrative rather than add piecemeal and decontextualised Aboriginal content into the\ncurriculum.\nUnfortunately, the impact of racism still permeates education, and some teachers are influenced by the\novergeneralisations, stereotypes and deficit discourses that position Aboriginal students and their families as the\nproblem and, through a perceived inability to assimilate, as responsible for their lack of success (Bodkin-\nAndrews & Carlson, 2014). Fortunately, many teachers are beginning to listen to Aboriginal voices, embrace truth\ntelling and implement inclusive classrooms where controversial and uncomfortable knowledges can be\ndiscussed respectfully.\nEducational policies supporting Learning from Country\nImportantly, Aboriginal curriculum is necessary for ALL students; it has not been constructed with only Aboriginal\nstudents in mind. In NSW, the Department of Education Aboriginal Education Policy has been mandatory since\n1987. Rather than summarising the current policy, we look back to the 1996 version for its clear and simple\narticulation of three key tenets that underpin all versions of the policy:\n1. \u201cAboriginal students: Curriculum, teaching and assessment programs will be challenging and culturally\nappropriate. Schools will have a supportive learning environment.\n2. Aboriginal communities: Aboriginal communities and the Department of School Education will become\npartners in the whole educational process.\n3. All sta\u0000 \u2013 all students \u2013 all schools: All Department of School Education sta\u0000 and students will have\nknowledge and understanding of, and respect for, Aboriginal Australia\u201d.\nThis and subsequent Aboriginal education policies are also reflected in two of the Australian Institute for\nTeachers and School Leadership (AITSL), Australian Professional Standards for Teachers:\n1.4.2 Design and implement e\u0000ective teaching strategies that are responsive to the local community and\ncultural setting, linguistic background, and histories of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students.\n2.4.2 Provide opportunities for students to develop understanding of, and respect for, Aboriginal and Torres\nStrait Islander histories, cultures and languages.\nSKNIL\nKCIUQ\n\uf179While past and present Aboriginal education policies provide teachers with the policy parameters to work within,\nteachers are yet to \u201cheed the call\u201d to enact the Aboriginal education imperatives (White et al., 2022) that have\nbeen articulated over many decades.\nThe Australian Curriculum\u02bcs Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cross Curriculum Priority (ACARA, 2011) is\ndesigned for application across KLAs and Stages. It consists of three interconnected aspects: Country/Place,\nCulture, and People, with three organising ideas in each. While these provide a reasonable base to work from,\nthere are clear omissions that not all teachers will recognise or address. These include the lack of breadth and\ndepth of Aboriginal content where concepts such as self-determination, Aboriginal resistance, treaty, truth\ntelling, and racism are absent (Lowe & Yunkaporta, 2013). Moreover, while there has been a plethora of resources\ndeveloped over the last decade or so, they have\u2018unfortunately been le\u0000 to sit on the \u201cvirtual shelf\u201d to date, with\nminimal uptake by the teaching profession\u02bc(White et al., 2022, p. 13)\nThe Learning from Country Framework\nWe have created an LFC framework that can be used by teachers to localise curriculum, build relationships with\ncommunity, engage learners, and create culturally responsive and sustaining classrooms. In describing the\nprocesses in Figure 1, we acknowledge the nonlinear, reflexive nature of Aboriginal Country-centred learning that\nlinks the past, present, and future.\nFigure 1.

It can be described as follows:\nThe dark blue acknowledges that Country is strong\u2014it is \u201cfull\u201d of knowledge. The light blue circles represent the\n\u201cactivity\u201d emanating and rippling throughout the Learning from Country processes which include deep listening to\nAboriginal community voices and truth telling \u2026 As each waterhole ripples with new knowledge and impacts on\nexisting knowledge, it flows into the next waterhole. The connecting waterways between the waterholes represent\nthe ebb and flow of knowledges and understandings that ripple through each waterhole. (Burgess et al., 2022a, p.\n164)\nCountry-centred relationships requires listening to local Aboriginal people about the cultural and socio-political\nhistory and current issues in the local area. Once you have begun this journey, you will be able to see, and enact,\nways of bringing Country into the classroom, as well as explore Country beyond the classroom door. This makes\nlearning more \u2018hands on\u02bc and engaging for students and contributes to a local Aboriginal narrative for use in your\ncurriculum.\nRelating deepens these connections through truth telling which includes listening to Aboriginal lived experiences\nof colonisation in this country. While this can be uncomfortable or even distressing, it is important to emotionally\nengage with these narratives to build empathy and understanding and to create a sense of belonging for\neveryone involved in this process. The Aboriginal community-based educators o\u0000en talk about the healing\npower of these experiences and their sense of empowerment in educating future generations. To ensure you are\nbeing respectful, speak to Aboriginal sta\u0000 and get to know your students and families to seek advice. All\neducation systems have some level of regional and/or statewide support for teachers, and the NSW Aboriginal\nEducation Consultative Group (AECG) has local branch meetings you can attend.\nCritical engagement occurs when you reflect on the emotional and intellectual learning you have encountered\nthrough LFC experiences and prompts you to reflect on how this impacts your personal and professional identity.\nBy positioning yourself as a learner rather than a teacher, new ways of knowing, being and doing through an\nAboriginal lens, helps you reimagine what an Aboriginal curriculum narrative might look like.\nThe \u2018doing\u02bc occurs as you develop culturally nourishing and sustaining teaching and learning practices that\nengage all students and brings the school-community closer together. This occurs throughout the LFC processes\nas you continue to think about how you will enact LFC in your classroom and maintain the relationships\nnecessary to do this work.\nConclusion\nWe acknowledge that this is challenging work as it asks you to rethink how you experienced education, but once\nthe processes are underway, you will be rewarded by increased confidence in your curriculum and pedagogy,\nmore engaged learners and calmer classrooms. Building relationships and listening to Aboriginal people and\nCountry, is the place to start to develop an Aboriginal curriculum narrative. At the same time, you should explore\nresources and build your own knowledge of Aboriginal histories and cultures and reflect on these in relation to\nyour local community. Truth telling, listening to Aboriginal community narratives, and Learning from Country\nreveals paths of resistance, resilience, and activism to mobilise genuine educational change for future\ngenerations.\nSKNIL\nKCIUQ\n\uf179[1] We use the term \u2018Aboriginal\u02bc as this is the preferred term in our local communities and the preferred term of\nthe NSW Aboriginal Education Consultative Group Inc.

As a Gamilaroi woman, educator\nKEYWORDS\nand researcher, I contemplate the ways Indigenous sovereignty is\nIndigenous sovereignty;\nconceptualised and enacted by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander pattern thinking; country;\npeople in the country now known as Australia. This provides the time; relationality;\nfoundations to apply broader understandings of sovereignty to the intergenerational reciprocity;\nnotion of education sovereignty. Using narrative and storytelling, agency; Aboriginal education\nI aim to show education sovereignty before considering potential\nelements involved in doing education sovereignty.

These elements provide\na deeper understanding of what education sovereignty could look\nlike, and therefore another way of \u2018doing\u2019 education for all students,\ngrounded in Indigenous axiologies, ontologies and epistemologies.\nIntroduction\nSovereignty has been conceptualised and enacted by Aboriginal and Torres Strait\nIslander Peoples in Australia for tens of thousands of years. In this paper my focus is\non how Indigenous sovereignty can operate in educative terms today. There are\nnumerous examples of Indigenous education sovereignty being theorised and exercised\naround the world (cf. USA \u2013 Brayboy et al., 2015; Hawaii \u2013 Goodyear-Ka\u2019\u014dpua, 2013;\nUSA \u2013 McCarty & Lee, 2014; Canada \u2013 Pidgeon et al., 2013; Aotearoa/New Zealand \u2013\nSmith, 2000). However, with much literature focused on the content that is being\ntaught \u2013 for example: Indigenous languages; teaching about/through culture;\nIndigenous histories; dance; art; music; Indigenous values and beliefs \u2013 my intention\nis to turn the gaze onto the processes involved. There are many instances where the\ninstitution of schooling is attempting to adopt fragments of Indigenous content to\ninclude in classroom teaching and learning, sometimes in meaningful and enriching\nways, but often in tokenistic and problematic ways (Bishop et al., 2019; Blair, 2015). For\nexample, in Australia, there is a plethora of policy mandating teachers embed\nIndigenous perspectives in the classroom, with a core component of the Australian\nCONTACT Michelle Bishop michelle.bishop@mq.edu.au Macquarie School of Education, Macquarie University,\nSydney, Australia; Twitter: @MichelleABishop\n\u00a9 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group132 M. BISHOP\nCurriculum stating that teachers across all year levels and subject areas are to incorpo-\nrate the Cross-Curriculum Priorities: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Histories and\nCultures (Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA),\n2011). With such a professional requirement befalling on teachers, one would expect\nthere is adequate teacher development to fulfil such a responsibility. However, surpris-\ningly few teachers have had meaningful interactions with Torres Strait Islander and\nAboriginal peoples and there is a distinct lack of professional development to equip\nteachers to meet these obligations thoughtfully and respectfully (Moreton-Robinson\net al., 2012).\nIn considering education sovereignty based on my experiences in education, and from\nstories and knowledge I hold from my Old People, it is helpful to clearly distinguish\nbetween the institution of schooling and the education systems that have been occurring\nhere forever (cf. Bishop, 2020). As Narungga, Kaurna and Ngarrindjeri scholar Lester-\nIrabinna Rigney (2015) asserts, \u2018curriculum didn\u2019t arrive on a boat, pedagogy didn\u2019t\narrive on a boat, it was always here.\u2019 This paper will focus on these ancient Indigenous\neducation systems, looking to the processes (or elements) involved in enacting education\nsovereignty. Indigenous processes are sometimes overlooked in favour of content; how-\never, Indigenous processes sit at the heart of an intellectual genius that continues to\nsustain people, communities and Country1 (Yunkaporta, 2019). In addition, Indigenous\nprocesses are much harder to extract and exploit; they cannot be uplifted as easily as\ncontent and simply plonked into the classroom to appease policy requirements. Adopting\nthe processes of education sovereignty requires systemic change. As a Gamilaroi woman,\nan educator, student and researcher, a granddaughter, daughter and mother, grown up\non Dharawal Country, I hold stories, knowledge and relationships that affirm the genius\nof Indigenous knowledges. I wish to share these with you. I have no doubt that\nIndigenous ways of Knowing, Being and Doing (Martin, 2008) hold the potential to\nrevolutionise the way we see and do \u2018education\u2019, for the benefit of all peoples, Country\nand more-than-human entities.\nIn this paper, I adopt a future focus \u2013 looking towards the possibility and potentiality\nof education sovereignty. And why this is imperative and a matter of urgency. The usual\nconventions of academic writing are interspersed with narrative and reflections as\nmarked in italics. Additionally, I refrain from extensive critique on mainstream schooling\nin Australia and how schools continue to be sites of harm for Aboriginal and Torres Strait\nIslander students as this is well-established in the literature (cf. Bodkin-Andrews &\nCarlson, 2016; Brown, 2018; Lowe et al., 2014). First, I look to the broader literature on\nIndigenous sovereignty exclusively from the perspective of Indigenous scholars in\nAustralia before presenting a vignette to show education sovereignty in action. In\ncombination, the literature and reflections provide the foundations to think more deeply\nabout the elements and processes of education sovereignty, which I interpret to be:\nPattern Thinking; Country; Time; Relationality; Intergenerational Reciprocity; and\nAgency.\nRepresenting knowledge \u2013 a note on methodology\nThis paper is committed to outlining educative processes, and, as such, it is important\nI outline some of the processes I have employed in writing this paper.CRITICAL STUDIES IN EDUCATION 133\nYou will notice throughout this paper that I incorporate storytelling, observations and\nreflections within conventional academic writing. Storytelling and narrative work form\na way of theorising and representing knowledge that has existed for millennia: \u2018story-\ntelling as epistemology\u2019 (Sheehan & Walker, 2001, p. 15). It is appropriate then that\nstorytelling exists amongst an academic text, especially when considering Indigenous\neducation sovereignty. It is crucial I walk my talk and not just adopt Western processes\nand insert Indigenous content. It would be weird not to. I also talk to you, the reader,\ndirectly. I ask you questions, I prompt you to reflect and ponder. I am writing this to/\nfor you.\nI have deliberately cited mostly Indigenous authors and made introductions to their\nwork using their full name and where they are from. I do this to show my respect for their\nexceptional work and the way it has greatly informed my thinking. I acknowledge this\npaper does not and cannot provide extensive understandings of Indigenous education\nsovereignty from the perspectives of all Indigenous Peoples, in Australia or around the\nworld. It is not only scope and word limits that inhibit such an undertaking. Everyday\nIndigenous Peoples are practicing and theorising Indigenous education sovereignty in\nways which may not be observed, written about, peer-reviewed, published/publishable or\nable to be cited. But it is happening.\n\u2018Indigenous sovereignty has never been ceded\u2019\nExpressions of Indigenous sovereignty can redefine and reorient what we do and what we\nknow so that positive transformation may result (Larkin, 2007, p. 177).\nWhat is Indigenous sovereignty and how is it recognised and employed more broadly\nby Indigenous people in Australia? Sovereignty can be a slippery term, one that isn\u2019t\nwidely understood or agreed upon. In 2007, the ground-breaking book Sovereign Subjects\n(Moreton-Robinson, 2007a), edited by Goenpul scholar Aileen Moreton-Robinson, was\nreleased, containing the first collection of insights into Indigenous sovereignty by\nIndigenous scholars in Australia. Although the concept of Indigenous sovereignty\nappeared in discourse during the 1960s, prior to the book\u2019s release the majority of writing\non Indigenous sovereignty was told from the perspective of non-Indigenous scholars.\nThus, the book was momentous, and whilst not claiming to provide an all-encompassing\ndefinition of Indigenous sovereignty, it offers revelations and conceptualisations of what\nsovereignty means/could mean for Indigenous people, specific to an Australian context.\nThe purpose of this section is not to simply rehash the ideas presented in Sovereign\nSubjects (Moreton-Robinson, 2007a), nor provide an extensive discussion or a literature\nreview as such. It is also important to clarify that I have chosen to focus on the concept of\n\u2018sovereignty\u2019, rather than \u2018self-determination\u2019, although these terms are sometimes used\ninterchangeably. I do not claim to cover or express all ideas or understandings on\nIndigenous sovereignty, but rather seek to give a brief overview of the ways sovereignty\nis discussed and enacted in the academic literature by Indigenous scholars in Australia to\nassist in a greater understanding of how the principles of Indigenous sovereignty may be\napplied to education. Whilst reading, I contemplated three questions, including:\n(1) What is sovereignty from an Indigenous (Australian) perspective?134 M. BISHOP\n(2) Is this accepted by \u2018mainstream\u2019 Australia?\n(3) Is it different from Western notions of sovereignty?\nFrom an Indigenous perspective, sovereignty is multi-faceted, a concept that is actual,\nspiritual, psychological and political (Birch, 2007). Moreton-Robinson (2007b, p. 2) and\nGoenpul and Waka Waka scholar Tracey Bunda (2007, p. 75) both assert \u2018sovereignty is\nembodied.\u2019 In other words, our sovereignty is carried in our bodies and is enacted in our\neveryday lives, including our everyday struggles to retain autonomy (Birch, 2007; Bunda,\n2007). Furthermore, sovereignty \u2018is ontological (our being) and epistemological (our way\nof knowing), and it is grounded within complex relations derived from the intersub-\nstantiation of ancestral beings, humans and land\u2019 (Moreton-Robinson, 2007b, p. 2). In\nthis way, Indigenous sovereignty is decentralised and operates at the grass-roots, \u2018provid-\ning the capacity to exercise autonomy at both the individual and collective levels\u2019 (Larkin,\n2007, p. 168).\nWiradjuri scholar Wendy Brady (2007) explains that sovereignty impacts upon our\nrelationships with each other, with land, and how we perceive our past and future, whilst\nAboriginal activist Michael Mansell (2003, p. 5) defines sovereignty to be the \u2018right of\nauthority in a people to control their territory, and those in it.\u2019 Furthermore, he asserts\nthat sovereignty continues to exist \u2018even if a people are prevented from exercising it\u2019\n(Mansell, 2003, p. 5). For Gumilaroi scholar Bob Morgan (2018, p. 7), sovereignty is\na principle used to express \u2018the social and political rights, freedoms, and resources to\nmake decisions for socio-political change and development within the context of cultural\nsurvival and celebration.\u2019\nHowever, whilst many Indigenous people declare that \u2018Indigenous sovereignty has\nnever been ceded\u2019 (Moreton-Robinson, 2007c, p. 87), this is denied by Australian law\n(Moreton-Robinson, 2007b). Instead, there exists an assumption of patriarchal white\nsovereignty \u2013 tied to the theft of Indigenous lands and the death of Indigenous people \u2013\nwhereby \u2018Indigenous sovereignty is assumed to be foreclosed by this assumption\u2019\n(Moreton-Robinson, 2007c, p. 87). This is not just the position of governments, many\nnon-Indigenous Australians react defensively to the notion of Indigenous sovereignty.\nEualeyai/Kamillaroi scholar Larissa Behrendt (2003, p. 115) claims this is due to a lack of\nunderstanding of the term and \u2018the substance of what it is that Indigenous people are\nasking for in their political agenda.\u2019 Yet, Tanganekald and Meintangk scholar Irene\nWatson (2007, p. 20) poses \u2018is Indigenous sovereignty to be feared by Australia in the\nsame way as Aboriginal people fear white sovereignty and its patriarchal model of state \u2013\none which is backed by the power of force? Or is Aboriginal sovereignty different . . . ?\u2019\nThese questions are important, yet rarely enter the debate. What is it that many non-\nIndigenous Australians fear? Mere hints of Indigenous sovereignty have resulted in\nvehement backlash in the recurring debate to \u2018Change the Date\u2019.2 The call to change\nthe date is a timid step towards recognition of Indigenous sovereignty, invasion, dispos-\nsession and genocide, yet is largely met with hostility and defensiveness. At a federal level\nthe position is clear with Prime Minister Scott Morrison insisting in 2018 that \u2018indulgent\nself-loathing doesn\u2019t make Australia stronger\u2019, and in 2019, Home Affairs Minister Peter\nDutton warning local councils to remain apolitical after several councils shifted Australia\nDay celebrations away from 26 January (Baker, 2019). It seems, for now, the \u2018unfinishedCRITICAL STUDIES IN EDUCATION 135\nbusiness of Indigenous sovereignty continues to psychically disturb patriarchal white\nsovereignty\u2019 (Moreton-Robinson, 2007c, p. 93).\nIndigenous sovereignty differs significantly from Western constructions of sover-\neignty which are \u2018predicated on the social contract model, the idea of a unified supreme\nauthority, territorial integrity and individual rights\u2019 (Moreton-Robinson, 2007b, p. 2). On\nthe other hand, Aboriginal sovereignty is maintained through pre-existing, pre-European\nmodels of governance (Birch, 2007) which focuses on inclusivity and embraces diversity\n(Watson, 2007). In addition, Indigenous sovereignty is/continues to be sustainable, both\npolitically and culturally, regardless of legal recognition by state or federal governments\n(Birch, 2007). Indigenous peoples occupied the lands long before \u2018the formation of the\nnation states that invaded and dispossessed them\u2019 (Moreton-Robinson (2007b, p. 3). In\nother words, \u2018sovereignty within Indigenous communities themselves is not reliant on\neither European law, or occasional state paternalism\u2019 (Birch, 2007, p. 107). Sovereignty is\nnot lost through the process of invasion, we retain sovereign rights and responsibilities as\ncustodial peoples who have always belonged here. In a recent interview (Grant, 2017),\nMansell asserts \u2018the people of invaded countries do not lose their sovereign rights; at best\nthey temporarily lose their ability to exercise their rights.\u2019 However, Indigenous sover-\neignty need not pose a threat to Australian sovereignty. From a legal perspective,\nBehrendt (2013, p. 175) argues this fear is a falsehood as \u2018every day the law finds ways\nto balance sovereignty of local, state and federal governments.\u2019 Indeed, Aboriginal\nsovereignty may pose a \u2018solution to white supremacy in its deflation of power\u2019\n(Watson, 2007, p. 20).\nSovereignty is enacted in our everyday lives, through our relationships with each other\nand Country, and in the ways we think about and relate to the world around us. This\nextends to critiquing, reforming or resisting the pervasive mechanisms of colonialism\nthat have sought to annihilate and assimilate us. It is useful to have a broad under-\nstanding of the underlying principles of Indigenous sovereignty specific to the Australian\ncontext, including the strengths and the struggles, before applying these to education\nsovereignty.\nA current consideration\nIt would be neglectful if I didn\u2019t mention that, as I put the finishing touches on this paper\nin the year 2020, a pandemic spreads anxiety and fear across the globe. Country after\ncountry has locked down its borders and put laws in place to restrict the movement of\npeople. At the time of writing in Australia, pubs and clubs are closed, as are most shops,\nrestaurants and cafes. Streets are empty. Gathering in groups of more than two people is\nnow unlawful (except if you live in the same household) and even then \u2018social distancing\u2019\nmust be adhered to. In the state of New South Wales (NSW), the Premier has appointed\nthe NSW Police Commissioner to control the COVID-19 response with police order and\nriot squads cruising neighbourhoods, targeting parks and beaches to issue on-the-spot\nfines to loiterers void of a \u2018reasonable excuse\u2019.\nIn NSW, schools remain officially open, though parents are being urged to keep their\nchild/ren at home if possible, and many schools have migrated to an online learning\nplatform. This has prompted me to think deeply about my research, about education\nsovereignty, and, in particular, education futurities outside of colonial-controlled136 M. BISHOP\nschooling. With few options and little warning, schooling has been forced to shift in\nsubstantial ways. This response shows that whole-scale systemic change is possible, and is\ncapable of happening swiftly. Learning and teaching continue to happen during the\npandemic, albeit in different ways, on different terms. Often this occurs in a calmer home\nlearning environment; an \u2018informal way of learning that advocates student-chosen\nactivities rather than teacher-directed lessons\u2019 (English & Gribble, 2020, n.p). (How)\ncan these events inform and enrich the way schooling, education, parents/carers and\neducators are able to adapt and transform in innovative, future-focused ways?\nEducation \u2013 another way\nCan we, as Indigenous people, reclaim our way to be, to see, to think and to know, to speak\nfrom our sovereignty to offer a different way of being human that does not require us to\nmimic the cannibalism of the coloniser? (Moreton-Robinson, 2007a, p. 7).\nEducation is a term often used synonymously with schooling, though I don\u2019t see them\nas one and the same. For the most part, schooling is institutional; offering a mandated\ncurriculum as decided and approved by federal and state governments, delivered by\npeople who have the qualifications deemed to be legitimate (Bishop, 2020). Think about\nit, every day we send our young people to school. In Australia, we have to, it is\ncompulsory. Six hours a day, five days a week, 40 weeks a year, 13 consecutive years.\nFor Indigenous people, this is a long time to be sending our babies away to an institution\nwe know to have caused great harm to many of our communities.\nEducation, on the other hand, has been happening here for tens of thousands of years,\nvery successfully (Rigney, 2015). Knowledge has been exchanged for thousands of\ngenerations, ensuring continued sustenance and abundance for people, Country and\nthe more-than-human. Living, thriving, creating, nurturing. So, what if we decided to look\nto our old ways and started to \u2018do\u2019 education on our own terms? For all students,\ngrounded in Indigenous ways. What would that look and feel like? These questions get\nme excited. They\u2019re a bit cheeky too, and often when I pose them the conversation turns\nto a whisper, with a quick glance over shoulders to check who might be listening. Dare we\nimagine education another way? Dare we concoct our own future outside of colonial\ncontrol?\nAllow me to indulge in an extended vignette to show what education sovereignty\nmight look like:\nThousands of droplets smother the morning grass, the wood pile dark with dew. An assorted\ncollection of camping chairs are perched upright against the tree, our attempt to keep them\ndry overnight unsuccessful. We unfurl them, giving a gentle shake at arm\u2019s length, careful\nnot to spray ourselves. It\u2019s chilly. Each breath visible as we try to get the fire started.

It\u2019s excit-\ning to see how many \u2018school-aged\u2019 young people are here. It\u2019s not school holidays and, as\na former primary school teacher, I wonder how the conversation might have gone between\nparents/carers and teachers. Would the kids have to \u2018make up\u2019 the time they are away or do\nhomework whilst they are here?\nI\u2019m fortunate to meet and share camp with two exceptional young blackfullas, Emily and\nTim.4 Their tent is next door and the sound of their morning giggles brings smiles to my\nslumber. We sit around the fire each evening, sharing chocolate and marshmallows, talking\nabout our day. They propose scenarios like \u2018What if the campfire has been going for 4 hours\nand a storm came. Would it put the fire out?\u2019 And we ask questions back at them \u2018What time\nof year is it? What time of day? Are you close to the ocean or inland? What type of wood are\nyou using on the fire? How much rain falls?\u2019 Each scenario gets more and more elaborate,\ndetailed and inquisitive. They love building this \u2018riddle\u2019 for us to contemplate, and we love\nthe deep thinking that goes into their response, the care taken to avoid contradiction.\nDuring the day, Emily and Tim go to the cultural fire masterclass sessions with their Mum.\nSometimes they run off with the other kids, creating their own world together. Other times\nthey are mesmerised learning about the right fire and how to listen to and care for/with/as\nCountry. They come back to the campfire each afternoon bursting to share and discuss.\nTheir understanding of Indigenous knowledges and practices deepens, as does their recog-\nnition of the environmental crisis they will be tasked with solving. They are taught to carve\nwith care and weave with love, and they dance up on the final night; limbs abound with\nancestral memory.\nEmily is 9 and Tim is 7 years old. Their ability to process and synthesise complex informa-\ntion is astounding. They are thoughtful and respectful, as they grapple with the enormity of\nthese teachings. They are also joyful and a joy to be around. Months later, I\u2019m told by their\nMum that they are still talking about their time at the National Indigenous Fire Workshop.\nThe purpose of this vignette is to show what education sovereignty looks and feels like,\nand to emphasise the enjoyment of deep learning and critical thinking that took place\nthat week. For Emily and Tim, they weren\u2019t being assessed on their learning, there were\nno multiple-choice quizzes at the end of each day. They didn\u2019t write anything down. Yet,\nundoubtedly the learning that occurred was profound, enjoyable and long-lasting. I saw\nfirst-hand another way of \u2018doing\u2019 education. It involved intergenerational relationality;\nknowledge sharing through Indigenous pedagogies and processes; a different sense of\ntime; a reverence for Country; and respect, for real, not just compliance and obedience \u2013\nthe \u2018sit still\u2019 or \u2018put your hand up to talk\u2019 kind of \u2018respect\u2019 demanded in schools. But let\u2019s\nnot get lost in making comparisons. I know the current imposition of mass, compulsory\nschooling is a relatively recent phenomenon in Australia, an institution that has\nattempted to eradicate the existence of a very successful education system that has\nbeen occurring on/with Country forever. And I saw it, I felt it, that week, at the\nNational Indigenous Fire Workshop.\nShow, now tell: six elements of Indigenous education sovereignty\nOnly a model of sovereignty, defined as the social and political freedoms and resources to\nmake decisions for socio-political change and development within the context of cultural\nsurvival and celebration, can provide a fully adequate basis for success in Aboriginal\neducation (Morgan, 2018, pp. 11\u201312).138 M. BISHOP\nFrom here, I want to highlight six core elements, the processes, that work to describe\nIndigenous education sovereignty in more detail. These elements are happening all\naround us, all the time, in Indigenous communities and I interpret them to be: Pattern\nThinking; Country; Time; Relationality; Intergenerational Reciprocity; and Agency.\nHowever, it is important to note that this is neither an exhaustive list, nor a checklist.\nThe naming of elements is not intended to be used as a finite definition of Indigenous\neducation sovereignty. There is no universal version of Indigenous education sover-\neignty, nor should there be. Indigenous peoples across Australia (and the world) may (or\nmay not) have their own interpretations of education sovereignty. In addition, the\nelements I\u2019m presenting here are not \u2018new\u2019, these concepts have long been named and\ntheorised by Indigenous (and non-Indigenous) scholars and thinkers around the world\nin varied contexts (cf. Bawaka Country et al., 2015; Moodie, 2018; Moreton-Robinson,\n2017; Pidgeon et al., 2013; Tuck & McKenzie, 2015; Yunkaporta & Shillingsworth, 2020).\nMy intention in bringing these elements together is to provide one way (of many) to\nanswer the question \u2013 what is Indigenous education sovereignty?\nThe elements will vary according to Place, Peoples and Knowledges. You\u2019ll see them at\nplay on weekends, family gatherings, at protests and rallies. Around the campfire, lounge\nroom, backyard, or parking lot. The elements are interconnected and may differ in\nimportance depending on who you are, where you are, what knowledge you are sharing\nor being shared, and with whom.\nIt feels strange to single these elements out, extract them from their relationships and\nwrite about each separately. This is counter-intuitive to the message I\u2019m trying to convey.\nHowever, my purpose for doing so is to offer an in-depth discussion of each element and\nhow it might operate, provide examples to demonstrate this, before bringing them back\ntogether where they belong.\nPattern thinking\nPattern thinking is the ability to \u2018think critically and holistically \u2013 and look to other\nperspectives that span time, place and the more-than-human\u2019 (Bishop & Tynan, forth-\ncoming). It\u2019s about being attentive to the connections between things, rather than just\nfocusing on individual components. In this way, it enables complex thinking, to see all\nthings all at once. Thinking in this way, we can see themes and trends emerge from\nwhich we can make predictions or find solutions to complex problems (Yunkaporta,\n2019). Pattern thinking shows how the patterns of the past can shape the future by\nembracing a holistic picture of the world we live in, across time and space, regardless of\nwhether we are looking at numbers or physics or grammar or lifecycles. This is a way of\nthinking we should be striving for all young people to remember/develop in the face of\npotential human extinction (Tuck & McKenzie, 2015). It also enhances our brain\ncapacity, increasing complexity and resisting the urge to default into conditioning\nthat tells us to fragment time, schedule our days, separate and classify topics, subjects,\nideas.\nFor example, pattern thinking does not separate information into subjects and dis-\nciplines to be studied in isolation \u2013 history, maths, geography. Rather than isolate the\nvariables, pattern thinking considers entire systems and the connections between and\nacross systems. In the vignette above, Emily and Tim used pattern thinking to makeCRITICAL STUDIES IN EDUCATION 139\nenquiries and predictions about weather, climate, people and power, and the role of\ncultural fire in healing the dire state of Country. Try to use pattern thinking as you read\nthe rest of this section, connecting up the other elements as we go.\nCountry\nCountry is central to learning, to education. At least, it should be. From my Old People,\nI know Country is/as Mother, giving us everything we need to survive. Country is also\nteacher, with Hawaiian scholar Manulani Aluli-Meyer (2008, p. 219) stating \u2018one does\nnot simply learn about land, we learn best from land.\u2019 To truly listen, contemplate and\nlearn from/with Country takes humility, and a degree of comfort in not knowing. It also\nrequires knowledge, to spot the signs and patterns of Country and know how to read and\nshare these. Or to build genuine relationships with people who hold that knowledge.\nCountry teaches us to be patient, to go slowly, to give.\nUnangax\u02c6 scholar Eve Tuck and colleagues Marcia McKenzie, and Kate McCoy (2014,\np. 9) insist that Country is integral to storing knowledge, arguing \u2018land can be considered\nas a teacher and conduit of memory.\u2019 Through our relationships with Country (as well as\npeople and other entities) we engage in knowledge transmission where we can store (and\naccess) shared memory (Yunkaporta, 2019). This is foundational to building sustainable\nknowledge systems.\nCaring for/as Country continues to be part of our custodial responsibilities as\nIndigenous people. Arguably, this should be true for all non-Indigenous people too.\nFor example, in a sterile classroom environment, we put trust in books and computers to\ntell us all we need to know about Country, it is mediated. For Emily and Tim, they used\nobservation, listening and doing to learn about Country and fire, from Country and fire. It\nis only recently in human history that people have been severed from the land, yet for\nIndigenous people there remains a living memory of our connection to Country and the\nabundance and wellness this brings. Country can help all people to remember. Take\na moment to be outside, what can you see, hear, smell, feel, learn?\nTime\nPast, present and future as one time (Yunkaporta, 2019, p. 88).\nThere is a calmness to thinking and learning when we dismantle contemporary\nnotions of time; a freedom and sense of agency to stick with something, or move on.\nAs Bawaka Country et al. (2017, p. 2) note, time has been altered by Western societies,\nnow seen as a numerical measurement rather than an entity that is from/of place. It is no\nlonger commonplace to observe Country and the material environment as a way to tell\nand experience time (Bawaka Country et al., 2017). From an Indigenous perspective, time\ncannot be reduced to a number, it cannot exist in a linear form divided neatly into past,\npresent and future, or hours, minutes, seconds. In other words, it cannot (and should\nnot) exist as a universal truth (Matamua, 2020). As Bawaka Country et al. (2017, p. 86)\nstate \u2018time is not abstract, it is not empty, it does not exist separately from human and\nmore-than-human worlds.\u2019140 M. BISHOP\nWithout strict timetables and time-moving schedules, learning can be timeless. This is\nespecially the case when knowledge is shared through cultural activities such as dancing,\ncarving, weaving (Yunkaporta, 2019). Through non-linear notions of time, thinking can\nbe enabled and enhanced. In this way, learning is cyclical, emerging at different times,\nwhen needed. Ruminating through time. This level of complexity has the potential to\nincrease knowledge retention and recall because it is bound in what is to be known.\nFor example, mass compulsory schooling in Australia mandates that learning is\nuniversal \u2013 all students in each year/stage level must meet certain outcomes to progress.\nShifting perceptions of time changes this assumption of progression to one where\ndifferent knowledges are held and learnt by different people, based on their awareness,\nunderstanding, interest. In the vignette above, young people made decisions about their\nown learning, knowing when they needed \u2018time out\u2019 to process, and having the flexibility\nto do this without reprimand.\nRelationality\nOur sovereignty is strongest when we are strongest in ourselves. We are strongest in\nourselves when we are together (Behrendt, 2019, p. 175).\nEverything is connected. Stories and knowledges are shared through and in relation-\nships. Not only amongst people, but between people and Country, and our more-than-\nhuman kin. Similar to Country being a \u2018conduit of memory\u2019 (Tuck et al., 2014, p. 9),\nBama scholar Tyson Yunkaporta (2019) describes these interconnections as an external\nhard-drive, where knowledge shared between entities is stored in their relationships. On\nyour own, you may not recall everything, but once you are in relationship, it\u2019s all there.\nYou remember together. This is a very different approach to learning than is expected in\nschools where individuals are expected to recall vast amounts of information on their\nown, with standardised testing commonplace.\nThrough relationships, all involved are both teacher and learner, and caring becomes\nan ongoing commitment. Relationality is reciprocal you see, balancing care, warmth and\nunderstanding with responsibilities, obligations and respect. No one person or entity is\nbetter or more than the other. This form of connection is not based on positional\nauthority, or a system of rewards and punishments, but rather a commitment to fulfilling\nyour relational obligations: \u2018being accountable to your relations\u2019 (Wilson, 2008, p. 77).\nRelationality is not about separation, instead the emphasis is on coming together to\nshare knowledge from different places, communities, teachings. Relationality is also\nresponsive to place/space/time, acknowledging that Country can be teacher too, whether\nit\u2019s Crow or Seedling or Wind. Relationships with our more-than-human kin are just as\nimportant. This was evident at the National Indigenous Fire Workshop in the way\npeople, fire and Country taught and learnt in relationship. Emily and Tim didn\u2019t just\nlearn from fire, they learned from the relationships between fire and dance, weaving and\ncreating riddles, running on uneven ground and listening to Elders tell stories in non-\nlinear ways. Learning is never singular, it is sparked by the relationships between the\nlearner and the infinite entities to learn from.CRITICAL STUDIES IN EDUCATION 141\nIntergenerational reciprocity\nIntergenerational reciprocity combines the idea of intergenerational learning with\nreciprocity. Intergenerational reciprocity is not about authority, or having the quali-\nfications deemed necessary to \u2018teach\u2019, it\u2019s about acknowledging that everyone has\nsomething to share, and learn (Bishop et al., 2019). This is also bound in relationality,\nit is the strength of our relationships that enhance knowledge exchange and knowl-\nedge production. Learning from human and more-than-human entities who hold\ngenerations of stories and knowledge has the potential to drastically improve our\nfuturities.\nIntergenerational reciprocity recognises that knowledge is held communally, no one\nperson holds (or should hold) all the knowledge. As Yunkaporta (2019, p. 14) explains,\n\u2018our knowledge endures because everybody carries a part of it, no matter how fragmen-\ntary.\u2019 Our Old People have much to share, but also acknowledge they have much to learn\nfrom the young ones. As written elsewhere, Grandmother and Granddaughter perspec-\ntive (Bishop & Tynan, forthcoming) shows us humility and optimism when we are able to\nlisten to and learn from others\u2019 perspectives. Intergenerational reciprocity also highlights\nthat young people have much to offer, they are not sponges to be silenced and infused\nwith information according to a government-mandated curriculum, they carry knowl-\nedges, stories, curiosity. This defies typical teacher-student power relationships that\noperate in schools (Bishop & Durksen, 2020).\nIntergenerational reciprocity is a reminder of our deep obligations to one another, not\nsimply to give back, but to listen, share, give forward. To ignore these obligations often\nresults in various forms of extractivism, a process which annihilates Country, Peoples\nand more-than-humans (Simpson, 2017). With intergenerational reciprocity as a core\nprinciple of education, and living, we have a responsibility to do well by our Ancestors\nand Old People, and to become good Ancestors ourselves. In the vignette, Emily and Tim\nlearn from Elders, fire and possum skins. They also draw on their extensive knowledges\nto teach those around them willing to listen, including me and others fortunate to share\na campfire with them.\nAgency\nAgency is a concept that has been heavily theorised and can be somewhat ambiguous. In\nthis context, agency implies autonomy in how education unfolds. This encompasses\nprocess, content, pedagogy and is self-determining, responsive and contextual. By this\nI mean, the learning is entirely dependent on relationships, knowledge, Country, and\nwhat is relevant at that moment, to the people involved. This might be difficult for some\nto understand as, for many of us, we have been conditioned into a schooling system that\nis \u2018universal\u2019 or \u2018one size fits all\u2019, where students have access to the same information\ndepending on their year of birth. And whilst learning activities may vary depending on\nthe initiative of the individual school or teacher, curriculum and outcomes are pre-set\nand repeated year after year, or until the curriculum is changed.\nAgency also takes into account the local, paying attention to socio-cultural and socio-\nhistorical factors. It responds to where young people are at in their thinking, as well as the\nplace they are learning, who they are learning from, and the importance/relevance to the142 M. BISHOP\nworld around them \u2013 \u2018agency is not just the remit of humans\u2019 (Bawaka Country et al.,\n2013, p. 195). In this way, it is adaptive and can shift and change from moment to\nmoment. For Emily and Tim, they exercised agency in their commitment to listening and\nlearning in accordance with their interests, energy, relationality and protocols of respect.\nAgency is not only reactive, but proactive, in response to shifting notions of time and\nincreased capacity for criticality through pattern thinking.\nFor example, at the time of writing there is a worldwide pandemic. In helping my nieces\nand nephews with their schoolwork that has now been moved entirely online, there is\na noticeable absence of COVID-19 in the content being delivered. How are we preparing\nstudents for the future if they are not responding to the present? It seems that \u2018business as\nusual\u2019 has been the default in these (small, personal) instances; an insistence to continue\npractising exponents and analysing avant-garde artworks. Meeting pre-set outcomes\nappears to outweigh the importance of analysing and responding to what is happening now.\nInseparable \u2013 the weaving of the elements\nAboriginal people seek to engage and participate in learning experiences that enriches them\nintellectually, but never at the loss of their cultural identity and the values and traditions that\ninform their identity (Morgan, 2018, p. 6).\nIt has been difficult to isolate these elements and try to talk about them individually, when\nit is clear that they overlap, fit together, and complement each other. Did you notice this as\nyou read through the six elements? Pattern thinking teaches us how to see between and\nacross the elements, and Relationality shows us how they are all connected. Country reminds\nus that teaching and learning happens in many ways if we are prepared to stop and listen,\nand Time reveals an entity that is bound to Country and Patterns, rather than numbers and\nuniversal \u2018truths\u2019. Intergenerational reciprocity grounds us in our accountability to each\nother, and Agency keeps us responsive and adaptive to local and global contexts.\nThese important elements set the foundation for education sovereignty, offering an\ninsight into the ways in which education has been happening here for tens of thousands\nof years. I wonder, did you catch yourself thinking about how these elements would\n(never) fit into a school setting? I do this too sometimes. But remember, they\u2019re not\nmeant to, Indigenous education sovereignty is not about school reform, it is a movement\ntowards systemic change; restructuring of entire systems, including how communities\nand families operate. It will also require a revolution of our current economic system, but\nlet\u2019s leave that for another conversation!\nConclusion\nEducation sovereignty cannot be viewed in isolation from Indigenous sovereignty.\nEducation has been happening in Australia for thousands of generations yet \u2018modern\u2019\nsociety keeps deep and critical thinking at bay by forcing young people to attend school\nfor 13 years, then expecting them to sell their labour eight hours a day, five days a week,\n48 weeks of the year. There is little time for anything else. This model appears short-\nsighted, with profit and power underpinning the design of systems and structures.\nI understand that a common reaction to notions of education sovereignty may containCRITICAL STUDIES IN EDUCATION 143\narguments about practicalities, feasibility, or logistics (cf. Bishop, 2020). However, now\nmore than ever, as the world faces the COVID-19 pandemic, we can see that systemic\nchange is possible, and can happen quickly if we will it to. This current crisis presents us\nall with an opportunity to push for a momentous shift to change the way we interact with\neach other and the world. However, this will not be without challenges. It is important to\nremember that Whiteness has sought the eradication of Aboriginal Peoples and\nIndigenous Knowledges, infiltrating and colonising minds and bodies, far and wide.\nWhilst Indigenous sovereignty remains unrecognised by the Australian government,\nand a great proportion of the Australian public, many Indigenous people remain\nstaunch \u2013 our sovereignty has never been ceded. We are sovereign peoples. The six\nelements I have highlighted acknowledge this sovereignty and offer a more tangible way\nof seeing the processes involved in education sovereignty. The vignette from the National\nIndigenous Fire Workshop attempts to show these elements in action.\nEducation sovereignty needn\u2019t happen around the edges, on weekends or school\nholidays. And although the context I have presented is situated in Australia, there is\npotential these elements of education sovereignty can spark conversations elsewhere in\nthe world, particularly among other settler-states. Education sovereignty is something\nthat can and should be prioritised, for all young people, and for the health of future\ngenerations and Country.\nNotes\n1. \u2018Country\u2019, purposefully capitalised, is a term often used by Indigenous Peoples in Australia\nto refer to home/lands/skies/waters/places/entities.\n2. \u2018Change the Date\u2019 is a campaign targeted at the Australian Government and general\npopulation to consider changing the date of \u2018Australia Day\u2019. This is held on 26 January\neach year to commemorate the landing of the First Fleet, yet many Indigenous (and non-\nIndigenous) people see this as the beginning of a violent invasion, dispossession and\ngenocide.

This requires a radical break from state\neducation systems \u2013 systems that are primarily designed to produce communities of individuals\nwilling to uphold settler colonialism. This paper uses Nishnaabeg stories to advocate for a\nreclamation of land as pedagogy, both as process and context for Nishnaabeg intelligence, in\norder to nurture a generation of Indigenous peoples that have the skills, knowledge and values to\nrebuild our nation according to the word views and values of Nishnaabeg culture.\nKeywords: Nishnaabeg pedagogy; land based education; Indigenous Knowledge; resurgence\n1 The thinking within this paper was generated inside a community of intellectuals, artists, Elders and cultural\nproducers to whom I am both influenced by and accountable to.

This is a\ntraditional Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg story that I learned from Washkigaamagki (Curve Lake First Nation) Elder\nGidigaa Migizi (Doug Williams). This is my own re-telling of it, and it is one of the ways I tell it in March, when\nmy family and I are in the sugar bush, making maple syrup. I have chosen to gender the main character as a girl\nbecause I identify as a women, but the story can be and should be told using all genders. Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg\nrefers to Mississauga Ojibwe people, and our territory is the north shore of Lake Huron in what is now known as\nOntario, Canada. We are part of the larger Anishinaabeg nation.\n3 Kwezens literally means \u201clittle woman\u201d and is used to mean girl.\n4 Ziigwan is the first part of spring when the ice is breaking up and the snow is melting.\n5 Doodoom is an older Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg word that children use to for their mothers. It means \u201cmy\nbreastfeeder\u201d. I learned this word from Doug Williams.\n6 Ajidamoo is a red squirrel.Land as pedagogy 3\nShe\u2019s not building her nest\nGawiin, not yet.\nShe\u2019s not looking after any young.\nGawiin, too early.\nShe\u2019s just nibbling on the bark, and then doing some sucking.\nNibble, nibble suck.\nNibble, nibble suck.\nNibble, nibble, suck.\nNibble, nibble, suck.\nKwezens is feeling a little curious.\nSo she does it too, on one of the low branches.\nNibble, nibble suck.\nNibble, nibble suck.\nNibble, nibble, suck.\nNibble, nibble, suck.\nMMMMMMMMmmmmmm.\nThis stuff tastes good.\nIt\u2019s real, sweet water.\nMMMMmmmmmmmmmm.\nThen Kwezens gets thinking\nand she makes a hole in that tree\nand she makes a little slide for\nthat sweet water to run down\nshe makes a quick little container\nout of birch bark, and\nshe collects that sweet water\nand she takes that sweet water home\nto show his mama.\nThat doodoom is excited and she has three hundred questions:\n\u201cAh Kwezens, what is this?\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you find it?\u201d\n7 Gaawiin means no.4 L.

A different version of this story is told by a non-\nNative author (Cook, 1999). There are several other maple sugar origin stories, see the title story from The Gift Is in\nthe Making (Simpson, 2013) and Corbiere (2011).6 L. Simpson\nGiven lovingly to us by the spirits14\nThis spring, while tapping a stand of maple trees, I remembered that this is one of my favorite\nstories. It\u2019s one of my favorites because nothing violent happens in it. At every turn, Kwezens is\nmet with very basic, core Nishnaabeg15 values - love, compassion and understanding. She centres\nher day around her own freedom and joy \u2013 I imagine myself at seven running through a stand of\nmaples with the first warmth of spring marking my cheeks with warmth. I imagine everything\ngood in the world. My heart, my mind and my spirit are open and engaged and I feel as if I could\naccomplish anything. I imagine myself grasping at feelings I haven\u2019t felt before \u2013 that maybe life\nis so good that it is too short; that there really isn\u2019t enough time to love everything.\nIn reality, I have to image myself in this situation because, as a child, I don\u2019t think I was\never in a similar situation. My experience of education, from kindergarten to graduate school,\nwas one of coping with someone else\u2019s agenda, curriculum, and pedagogy, someone who was\nneither interested in my well being as a kwezens, nor interested in my connection to my\nhomeland, my language or history, nor my Nishnaabeg intelligence. No one ever asked me what\nI was interested in nor did they ask for my consent to participate in their system. My experience\nof education was one of continually being measured against a set of principles that required\nsurrender to an assimilative colonial agenda in order to fulfill those principles. I distinctly\nremember being in grade 3, at a class trip to the sugar bush, and the teacher showing us two\nmethods of making maple syrup \u2013 the pioneer method which involved a black pot over an open\nfire and clean sap, and the \u201cIndian method\u201d \u2013 which involved a hollowed out log in an unlit fire,\nwith large rocks in the log to heat the sap up \u2013 sap which had bark, insects, dirt and scum over it.\nThe teacher asked us which method we would use \u2013 being the only native kid in the class, I was\nthe only one that chose the \u201cIndian method\u201d\nThings are different for this Kwezens. She has already spent seven years immersed in a\nnest of Nishnaabeg intelligence. She already understands the importance of observation and\nlearning from our animal teachers, when she watches the squirrel so carefully and then mimics\nits actions. She understands embodiment and conceptual thought, when she then takes this\nobservation and applies it to her own situation \u2013 by making a cut in the maple tree and using a\ncedar shunt. She relies upon her own creativity to invent new technology. She patiently waits for\nthe sap to collect. She takes that sap home and shares it with her family. Her mother, in turn,\nmeets her daughter\u2019s discovery with love and trust. Kwezens watches as her mama uses the sap\nto boil the deer meat for supper. When she tastes the deer, the sweetness, she learns about\nreduction, and when her mama and her go to clean the pot, she learns about how sap can be\n14 This subheading comes from the work of Anishinaabe scholar Wendy Makoons Geniusz, and her translation of\nthe Anishinaabeg word gaa-izhi-zhaawendaagoziyaang, see p. 67 of (Geniusz, 2009). Anishinaabe (north western\ndialect is the same as Nishnaabe (south eastern dialect).\n15 I am using the term Nishnaabeg to refer to Ojibwe, Odawa, Bodawadami, Mississauga/Michi Saagiig, Sauteaux,\nChippewa, Nipissing, our relatives Omawinini and all the various groups of peoples that make up our nation.Land as pedagogy 7\nboiled into sugar. Kwezens then takes her Elders to the tree already trusting that she will be\nbelieved, that her knowledge and discovery will be cherished, and that she will be heard.\nKwezens learned a tremendous amount over a two-day period \u2013 self-led, driven by both\nher own curiosity and her own personal desire to learn. She learned to trust herself, her family\nand her community. She learned the sheer joy of discovery. She learned how to interact with the\nspirit of the maple. She learned both from the land and with the land. She learned what it felt like\nto be recognized, seen and appreciated by her community. She comes to know maple sugar with\nthe support of her family and Elders. She comes to know maple sugar in the context of love.\nTo me, this is what coming into wisdom within a Michi Saagiig Nishnaabe epistemology\nlooks like \u2013 it takes place in the context of family, community and relations. It lacks overt\ncoercion and authority, values so normalized within mainstream western pedagogy that they are\nrarely ever critiqued. The land, aki, is both context and process. The process of coming to know\nis learner-led and profoundly spiritual in nature.16 Coming to know is the pursuit of whole body\nintelligence practiced in the context of freedom, and when realized collectively it generates\ngenerations of loving, creative, innovative, self-determining, inter-dependent and self-regulating\ncommunity minded individuals. It creates communities of individuals with the capacity to uphold\nand move forward our political traditions and systems of governance.\nI am using Kwezens\u2019 story here in the same way it is used within Nishnaabeg intelligence\n- as a theoretical anchor whose meaning transforms over time and space within individual and\ncollective Nishnaabeg consciousness. A \u201ctheory\u201d in its simplest form is an explanation of a\nphenomenon, and Nishnaabeg stories in this way form the theoretical basis of our intelligence.\nBut theory also works a little differently within Nishnaabeg thought. \u201cTheory\u201d is generated and\nregenerated continually through embodied practice and within each family, community and\ngeneration of people. \u201cTheory\u201d isn\u2019t just an intellectual pursuit \u2013 it is woven within kinetics,\nspiritual presence and emotion, it is contextual and relational. It is intimate and personal, with\nindividuals themselves holding the responsibilities for finding and generating meaning within\ntheir own lives.\nMost importantly, \u201ctheory\u201d isn\u2019t just for academics; it\u2019s for everyone. And so, the story\nof maple sugar gets told to (some of) our kids almost from birth. \u201cTheory\u201d within this context is\ngenerated from the ground up and its power stems from its living resonance within individuals\nand collectives. Younger citizens might first understand just the literal meaning. As they grow,\nthey can put together the conceptual meaning, and with more experience with our knowledge\nsystem, the metaphorical meaning. Then they start to apply the processes and practices of the\nstory in their own lives (when I have a problem, I\u2019ll call my aunties or my grandparents), and\n\u201cmeaning-making becomes an inside phenomenon\u201d17. After they live each stage of life through\nthe story, then they can communicate their lived wisdom, understood through six or seven\ndecades of lived experience and shifting meaning. This is how our old people teach. They are our\n16 Geniusz (2009, p. 67) calls this process of coming to known gaa-izhi-zhaawendaagoziyaang \u2013 that which is given\nlovingly to us by the spirits.\n17 Manulani Meyers, June 3, 2014.8 L. Simpson\ngeniuses because they know that wisdom is generated from the ground up, that meaning is for\neveryone, and that we\u2019re all better when we\u2019re able to derive meaning out of our lives and be our\nbest selves (Simpson, 2013, pp. 3-7; Doerfler, Sinclair & Stark, 2013, pp. xv-xxvii). Stories\ndirect, inspire and affirm ancient code of ethics.18 If you do not know what it means to be\nintelligent within Nishnaabeg realities, then you can\u2019t see the epistemology, the pedagogy, the\nconceptual meaning, or the metaphor. You can\u2019t see how this story has references to other parts\nof our oral tradition, or how this story is fundamentally, like all of our stories, communicating\ndifferent interpretations and realizations of a Nishnaabeg worldview.\nIt is critical to avoid the assumption that this story takes place in pre-colonial times\nbecause Nishnaabeg conceptualizations of time and space present an on-going intervention to\nlinear thinking - this story happens in various incarnations all over our territory every year in\nMarch when the Nishnaabeg return to the sugar bush. Kwezen\u2019s presence (and the web of\nkinship relations that she is composed of) is complicated by her fraught relationality to the\ntenacity of settler colonialism (Martineau and Ritskes, 2014, p. II), and her very presence\nsimultaneously shatters the disappearance of Indigenous women and girls from settler\nconsciousness. She also escapes the rigidity of colonial gender binaries by having influence and\nagency within her family, while physically disrupting settler colonial commodification and\nownership of the land through the implicit assumption that she is suppose to be there. Her\nexistence as a hub of intelligent Nishnaabeg relationality may be threatened by land theft,\nenvironmental contamination, residential schools and state run education, and colonial gender\nviolence, but Kwezens is there anyway, making maple sugar as she always has done, in a loving\ncompassionate reality, propelling us to re-create the circumstances within which this story and\nNishnaabewin19 takes place. Propelling us to rebel against the permanence of settler colonial\nreality and not just \u201cdream alternative realities\u201d but to create them, on the ground in the physical\nworld, in spite of being occupied. If we accept colonial permanence, then our rebellion can only\ntake place within settler colonial thought and reality; we become too willing to sacrifice the\ncontext that creates and produces cultural workers like Kwezens.\nWhat if Kwezens had accepted the permanence of settler colonialism as an unmovable\nreality?\nWhat if Kwezens had no access to the sugar bush because of land dispossession,\nenvironmental contamination or global climate change?\nWhat if the trauma and pain of on-going colonial gendered violence had made it\nimpossible for her mama to believe her or for her mama to reach out and so gently rub her lower\nback at that critical point? What if that same trauma and pain prevented her aunties and elders to\n18 Manulani Meyers, June 3, 2014.\n19 Nishnaabewin means all things Nishnaabe. It is a broad term that in my mind encompasses all that is meant by the\nterm Nishnaabe intelligence. I learned this word from Doug Williams. I am using it here in a similar way to the\nOjibwe Cultural Foundation in their annual Anishinaabewin Conference in Sudbury, ON. Other Anishinaabe\nscholars such as Geniusz use the term gikendaasowin for knowledge that is also correct, but not common in the area\nwhere I live. Nishnaabewin includes Nishnaabemowin (Ojibwe language).Land as pedagogy 9\ngather around and support her when there were technical difficulties? What if settler-colonial\nparenting strategies positioned the child as \u201cless believable\u201d than an adult?\nWhat if Kwezens had been in a desk at a school that didn\u2019t honour at its core her potential\nwithin Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg intelligence? Or if she had been in an educational context\nwhere having an open heart was a liability instead of a gift? What if she had not been running\naround, exploring, experimenting, and observing the squirrel - completely engaged in a Michi\nSaagiig Nishnaabeg ways of knowing? What if she hadn\u2019t been on the land at all?\nWhat if Kwezens lived in a world where no one listened to girls? Or where she had been\nmissing or murdered before she ever made it out to the sugar bush?\nWhat if the university got ahold of the sugar bush and made Kwezens get SSHRC\nfunding before she could go out in the field? What if she was home reading the course outline of\nsomeone else\u2019s learning objectives? What if she never gave the sap to her doodoom but instead\nwent to her computer to type up her research report?\nWhat if Kwezens motivation for learning wasn\u2019t her own curiosity and joy, but\nrecognition within the state-run education system? What then?\nIt comes through the land\nFor me, this story is a critical intervention into current thinking around Indigenous education,\nbecause Indigenous education is not Indigenous or education from within our intellectual\ntraditions unless it comes through the land, unless it occurs in an Indigenous context using\nIndigenous processes (Deloria, 2001, pp. 58-59). To re-create the world that compelled Kwezens\nto learn how to make maple sugar, we should be concerned with re-creating the conditions within\nwhich this learning occurred, not merely the content of the practice itself. Setters easily\nappropriate and reproduce the content of the story every year, within the context of capitalism,\nwhen they make commercial maple syrup; but they completely miss the wisdom that underlies\nthe entire process because they deterritorialize the mechanics of maple syrup production from\nNishnaabeg intelligence and from aki. They appropriate and recast the process within a hyper-\nindividualism that negates relationality. The radical thinking and action of this story is not so\nmuch in the mechanics of reducing maple sap to sugar, it lies in the reproduction of a loving web\nof Nishnaabeg networks within which learning takes place.\nFor countless generations, Nishnaabeg children grew up within the milieu of\nNishnaabewin, not within the institutionalized schooling system. Many of our children still do,\nthanks to parents, grandparents and communities. Like governance, leadership and every other\naspect of reciprocated life, education comes from the roots up. It comes from being enveloped by\nland. An individual\u2019s intimate relationship with the spiritual and physical elements of creation is\nat the centre of a learning journey that is life-long (Deloria, 2001, p. 60). You can\u2019t graduate\nfrom Nishnaabewin; it is a gift to be practiced and reproduced. And while each individual must\nhave the skills and knowledge to ensure their own safety, survival and prosperity in both the\nphysical and spiritual realm, their existence is ultimately dependent upon intimate relationships10 L. Simpson\nof reciprocity, humility, honesty and respect with all elements of creation, including plants and\nanimals.\nNishnaabeg-Gikendaasowin, or Nishnaabeg knowledge,20 originates in the spiritual\nrealm, coming to individuals through dreams, visions, ceremony and through the process of gaa-\nizhi-zhaawendaagoziyaang \u2013 that which is given lovingly to us by the spirits (Geniusz, 2009, p.\n67). This makes sense because this is the place where our ancestors reside, where spiritual beings\nexist, and where the spirits of living plants, animals and humans interact. In order to gain access\nto this knowledge, one has to align themselves within and with the forces of the implicate order21\nthrough ceremony, ritual and the embodiment of the teachings one already carries (Henderson\n2000).\nWithin this system there is no standard curriculum because it is impossible to generate a\ncurriculum for \u201cthat which is giving to us lovingly from the spirits,\u201d and because it doesn\u2019t make\nsense for everyone to master the same body of factual information. Nishnaabeg society, in its\nfullest realization, requires a diversity of excellence to continue to produce an abundance of\nsupportive relationships. Within the context of humility and agency, decisions around learning\nare in essence an agreement between individuals and the spirit world. Nishnaabewin fosters and\ncherishes individuals with particular gifts and skills as a mechanism for growing diversity, and\nchildhood is an excellent time for individuals to focus in on those particular gifts and hone them\ninto excellence. Just as it is unthinkable within a Nishnaabeg worldview for a leader to impose\ntheir will on their people, it is unthinkable to impose an agenda onto another living thing \u2013 in\nessence, the context is the curriculum and land, aki, is the context (Cajete, 1994).\nIn addition to the land (including the spiritual world), the context for Nishnaabewin is\nprofoundly intimate. Gaa-izhi-zhaawendaagoziyaang requires long-term, stable, balanced warm\nrelationships within the family, extended family, the community and all living aspects of\ncreation. Intelligence flows through relationships between living entities. Gaa-izhi-\nzhaawendaagoziyaang requires love, the word zhaawen, a part of the word Gaa-izhi-\nzhaawendaagoziyaang, means to have complete \u201ccompassion for another in one\u2019s thoughts and\nmind. It has a connotation of bestowing kindness, mercy, and aid. It includes ideas of pity,\nempathy and deep unconditional love\u201d (Borrows, 2014).22 Anishinaabe scholar John Borrows\n(2014) explains:\n\u201cFor instance, my friend Kekek notes that zhawenjige is another derivation of\nzhawenim. It means to hunt. We hear the word used in hunting and harvesting\n20 Geniusz (2009, p.11) defines anishinaabe-gikendaasowin as knowledge, information and the synthesis of our\npersonal teachings; anishinaabe-inaadisiwin as anishinaabe psychology, way of being, and anishinaabe-izhitwaawin\nas anishinaabe culture, teachings, customs, history; aadizookaanan as traditional legends and ceremonies, and\ndibajimowinan as personal stories and history. I include all of these components in the term Nishnaabewin.\n21 This is a term used to refer to the spiritual world by S\u00e1k\u00e9j Youngblood Henderson (2006) in First Nations\nJurisprudence and Aboriginal Rights: Defining a just society, Saskatoon: University of Saskatchewan, Native Law\nCentre.\n22 Also see pp. 37-41 (Simpson 2011).Land as pedagogy 11\nsongs. When we sing zhawenim izhichige it means \u201cyou will be pitied, or have\nmercy placed upon you in your actions and what you are doing\u201d. The idea behind\nthis word is that when we acknowledge our relations with the world, and our\nresponsibilities to each other, then we will all be blessed or find love and\ncompassion. We will be nourished, sustained and taken care of. The idea of\nzhawenjige is said to be part of an old treaty the Anishinaabe made with the\nanimals. As long as we love them they will provide for us, and teach us about love\nand how to live well in the world\u201d (p. 11).\nMeaning then is derived not through content or data, or even theory in a western context,\nwhich by nature is decontextualized knowledge, but through a compassionate web of\ninterdependent relationships that are different and valuable because of that difference.\nIndividuals carry the responsibility for generating meaning within their own lives \u2013 they carry\nthe responsibility for engaging their minds, bodies and spirits in a practice of generating\nmeaning. Within Nishnaabewin, I am responsible for my thoughts and ideas. I am responsible for\nmy own interpretations and that is why you\u2019ll always hear from our Elders what appears to be\nthem \u2018qualifying\u2019 their teachings with statements that position them as learners, that position\ntheir ideas as their own understandings, and place their teachings within the context of their own\nlived experience. This is deliberate, ethical and profoundly careful within Nishnaabewin because\nto do otherwise is considered arrogant and intrusive with the potential to interfere with other\nbeings\u2019 life pathways.23 Although individuals have the responsibility to self-actualize within this\nsystem, intelligence in this context is not an individual\u2019s property to own; once an individual has\ncarried a particular teaching around to the point where they can easily embody that teaching,\nthey, then, also become responsible for sharing it according to the ethics and protocols of the\nsystem. This is primarily done by modeling the teaching or, as Elder Edna Manitowabi says,\n\u201cwearing your teachings.\u201d24\nContinually generating meaning is often, but not exclusively, done in ceremony and\ninvolves ongoing ethical systems of accountability and responsibility, particularly around\nemotional trauma and healing.25 Individual generated meaning is an authentic and grounded\npower. These meanings, in all of their diversity, then become the foundation of generated\ncollective meanings and a plurality of truths (Simpson, 2011, p. 58). This collective process,\noperationalized within Nishnaabeg political traditions, for example, generates a series of\n23 Doug Williams taught me this concept through the word dnaagaa\u2019aa (my phonetic spelling) in the context of\nhunting. It means \u201cdon\u2019t hurt anything if you don\u2019t need to, because you are stopping their path in life, have total\ncompassion for other living beings.\u201d\n24 I have heard Nishnaabe Elder Edna Manitowabi explain this countless times, and following Nishnaabeg protocols\nwould like to acknowledge this here.\n25 To me this is actually a critical part of the system. Being accountable and self aware of one\u2019s own flaws and now\nin the context of settler colonialism, one\u2019s experience with trauma and violence becomes critical to operationalizing\nNishnaabeg intelligence.12 L. Simpson\ncollective meanings, including dissention, that make sense within broad and multiple\ninterpretations of Nishnaabeg values and philosophies.26\nNishnaabeg intelligence is diversity27\nThere are unseen forces or spiritual elements that hold power and influence in the story of maple\nsugar that are only alluded to within the narrative, at least in part because older Nishnaabeg\nteachers culturally talk about these things as if they are sitting beside us in a room rather then\ncoming directly at it. There is an implicit assumption in this story that Kwezens offered tobacco\nto the maple tree before she cut the bark to collect the sap. She does this as a mechanism to set\nup a relationship with the maple tree that is based on mutual respect, reciprocity, and caring. By\nplacing the tobacco down, she is speaking directly to the spirit of the maple tree. I understand it\nas her spirit speaking directly to the spirit of the maple tree, entering into a balanced relationship\nof mutuality. The maple tree does not have to produce sap for Kwezens, the tree has agency over\nthis act. Kwezens also has agency \u2013 she has chosen to act in a way that aligns herself with the\nactions and beliefs her people know promote more life and interconnection within Kina Gchi\nNishnaabeg-ogamig.28 There are also several other spiritual interactions involved in this story of\nlovingly coming to know \u2013 the spirit of the squirrel, the spirits of her family that supported her,\nand the spirits of her ancestors. Within a Nishnaabeg epistemology, spiritual knowledge is a\ntremendous, ubiquitous source of wisdom that is the core of every system in the physical world.\nThe implicate order provides the stories that answer all of our questions. The way we are taught\nto access that knowledge is by being open to that kind of knowledge and by being engaged in a\nway of living that generates a close, personal relationship with our ancestors and relations in the\nspirit world through ceremony, dreams, visions and stories. The implicate order does not\ndiscriminate by gender, by age, by ability, or any of those things. The implicate order only cares\nif you believe; if you\u2019re living your life in an engaged way. If we are open to this, then\nknowledge will flow through us based on our own actions, our name, clan, and helpers and our\nown self-actualization, as long as we uphold these responsibilities.\nKwezens already lives in a reality where the spiritual world has tremendous presence in\neach moment. Kwezens is a vessel of resurgence. She is a leader. She embodies the core\n26 It is my understanding that there is a high degree of non-interference into the intimate truths of individuals, and\nalso a collective high degree of non-interference for groups of people to hold different truths. There is respect for\nthis diversity. This is balanced with collective processes \u2013 ceremony and political processes (in governance, the\ngeneration of consensus for example) that move for instance seven collective truths into an eighth understanding,\nwhile still acknowledging and validating dissenting views. See Simpson (2011, p. 58) for a more detailed\nexplanation.\n27 I started to think about Nishnaabeg intelligence after several discussions with Hawaiian thinker Manulani Meyer\nbetween 2012 and 2014 Peterborough, Ontario and Vancouver, BC. See Meyer (2014).\n28 This is a Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg name for our territory or nation that means the place where we all live and\nwork together, and conceptually emphasizes the relational aspect of our conceptualization of nationhood. It refers to\nthe north shore of Lake Ontario. See Simpson (2011, p.14) for a more detailed explanation.Land as pedagogy 13\nteachings and philosophies of Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg culture. She paid attention to our\ncreation story \u2013 the one that says Nishnaabewin is both intellectual knowledge and heart\nknowledge, the one that says you have to be fully present in all aspects of your physical and\nspiritual body to access the gift of knowledge from the spiritual world (Simpson, 2011).\nKwezens very clearly represents the kind of citizen capable of upholding the tenets of our nation,\nin spite of settler colonialism. She is in essence the goal of community, the re-creation of beings\nthat continually live lives promoting the continuous rebirth of life itself (LaDuke, 1994).\nKwezens represents Nishnaabeg resurgence \u2013 the rebuilding of Indigenous nations according to\nour own political, intellectual and cultural traditions. We need to re-establish the context for\ncreating a society of Kwezens because we need to recreate a society of individuals that can think\nand live inside the multiplicity of our culture and our intelligence.\nThis presents Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg people with a critical task \u2013 if we do not create a\ngeneration of people attached to the land and committed to living out our culturally inherent\nways of coming to know, we risk losing what it means to be Nishnaabeg within our own thought\nsystems (Alfred, 1999; 2005). We simply cannot bring about the resurgence of our nations if we\nhave no one that can think within the emergent networks of Nishnaabeg intelligence. We cannot\nbring about the kind of radical transformation we seek if we are solely reliant upon state\nsanctioned and state run education systems. We cannot carry out the kind of decolonization our\nancestors set in motion if we don\u2019t create a generation of land based, community based\nintellectuals and cultural producers who are accountable to our nations and whose life work is\nconcerned with the regeneration of these systems, rather than meeting the overwhelming needs\nof the western academic industrial complex or attempting to \u201cIndigenize the academy\u201d29 by\nbringing Indigenous Knowledges into the academy on the terms of the academy itself. Our\nancestors\u2019 primary concern in \u201ceducating\u201d our young people was to nurture a new generation of\nElders \u2013 of land based intellectuals, philosophers, theorists, medicine people, and historians who\nembodied Nishnaabeg intelligence in whatever time they were living in because they had lived\ntheir lives through Nishnaabeg intelligence.\nThey embodied Nishnaabeg intelligence because they were practitioners of Nishnaabeg\nintelligence.\nNishnaabeg intelligence has been violently under attack since the beginning days of\ncolonialism through processes that remove Indigenous peoples from our homelands, whether\nthose processes are residential and other forms of state run schools, outright dispossession, the\ndestruction of land through resource extraction and environmental contamination, imposed\npoverty, or heteropatriarchal and colonial gendered violence. Our peoples have always resisted\nthis destruction by engaging in Nishnaabewin, whenever and wherever they could. I would not\n29 While Indigenous scholars, students and leaders have made substantial in roads in some disciplines of the\nacademy in terms of curriculum and programing, we have been much less successful in gaining the academy\u2019s\nrecognition of Indigenous Knowledge systems and intelligence on their own merits, and far less successful in\ndismantling systems of domination and oppression, dispossession and erasure advanced by the academy. While\nthere are sites of decolonization within academic institutions, they still remain a colonizing force upholding the\nvalues of heteropatriarchy, settler colonialism and capitalism.14 L. Simpson\nexist, writing this paper today, if it were not for the physical survival of several generations of\nNishnaabeg women in my family and the heart breaking sacrifices of my Elders who resisted\ncolonial educational practices and live out their commitment to teaching others, the vast majority\nof the time in the absence of compensation or deep reciprocity, and outside of the provincial\neducation and the post-secondary education system. Not one time has an Elder ever told me to go\nto school to learn Indigenous Knowledge. Not one time has an Elder told me to go and get a\ndegree so that I can pass Indigenous Knowledge down to my children. Yet, we place tremendous\npressure on our youth to gain western academic credentials. This seems highly problematic to\nme; we desperately need a new generation of thinkers who are articulate and brilliant from\nwithin Nishnaabewin, a generation that can think within our philosophies and enact those\nphilosophies as a living and breathing imposition to colonialism as every generation has done in\nsome capacity before us. Otherwise, we risk losing being Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg. To create a\nnation of Kwezens \u2013 to survive as Nishnaabeg \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t be just striving for land-based\npedagogies. The land must once again become the pedagogy.\nIntelligence as consensual engagement\nKwezens very clearly embodies the idea of land as pedagogy as she went about her day learning\nwith and from maple trees, among many other beings. Kwezens had already grown up in a\ncommunity where the adult practitioners of Nishnaabeg intelligence were teaching her through\nmodeling how to interact with all elements of creation. So, on one hand, Kwezens was just doing\nwhat she had seen the adults in her life do everyday over and over again in a variety of different\nactivities. On a deeper level, Kwezens was also teaching us by \u2018modeling\u2019; her story aligns itself\nwith our embodied theory, our Creation stories.\nGzhwe Manidoo30 in the very beginning of the cosmos and in the continual creation of\nNishnaabeg ontology, axiology, and epistemology, set up the context for Nishnaabeg reality\n(Henderson, 2000; Little Bear, 2000). The context was the earth that Gzhwe Manidoo created\nand Nishnaabeg conceptualizations of aki are at their core profoundly relational. Borrows (2014)\nexplains it this way:\nThe Anishinaabe have long taken direction about how we should live through our\ninteractions and observations with the environment. People regulate their behavior\nand resolve their disputes by drawing guidance from what they see in the behavior\nof the sun, moon, stars, winds, waves, trees, birds, animals, and other natural\nphenomenon. The Anishinaabe word for this concept is gikinawaabiwin. We can\nalso use the word akinoomaage, which is formed from two roots: aki: noomaage.\n\u2018Aki\u2019 means earth and \u2018noomaage\u2019 means to point towards and take direction\nfrom. As we draw analogies from our surroundings, and appropriately apply or\n30 The Creator, the one who loves us unconditionally, according to Doug Williams. See endnote 60 in Simpson\n(2011, p. 46).Land as pedagogy 15\ndistinguish what we see, we learn about how love, and how we should live in our\nlands. (p.10)\nAki includes all aspects of creation: land forms, elements, plants, animals, spirits, sounds,\nthoughts, feelings, energies and all of the emergent systems, ecologies and networks that connect\nthese elements. Knowledge in akinoomaage flows through the layered spirit world above the\nearth, the place where spiritual beings reside and the place where our ancestors sit (Geniusz,\n2009).\nIn the Nishnaabeg creation stories told and discussed in Dancing on our turtle\u2019s back:\nStories of re-creation, resurgence and a new emergence, the process in which Gzhwe Manidoo\ncreated the world is the process by which Nishnaabeg people come to know. Coming to know is\na mirroring or a re-enactment process where we understand Nishnaabeg epistemology to be\nconcerned with embodied knowledge animated, collectively, and lived out in a way in which our\nreality, nationhood and existence is continually reborn through both time and space. This\nrequires a union of both emotional knowledge and intellectual knowledge in a profoundly\npersonal and intimate spiritual context. Coming to know is an intimate process, the unfolding of\nrelationship with the spiritual world.\nComing to know also requires complex, committed, consensual engagement.\nRelationships within Nishnaabewin are based upon the consent \u2013 the informed (honest) consent \u2013\nof all beings involved. The word consensual here is key because if children learn to normalize\ndominance and non-consent within the context of education, then non-consent becomes a\nnormalized part of the \u2018tool kit\u2019 of those who have and wield power. Within the context of settler\ncolonialism, Indigenous peoples are not seen as worthy recipients of consent, informed or\notherwise, and part of being colonized is having to engage in all kinds of processes on a daily\nbasis that, given a choice, we likely wouldn\u2019t consent to. In my experiences with the state-run\neducation system, my informed consent was never required \u2013learning was forced on me using\nthe threat of emotional and physical violence. In post-secondary education, consent was coercive\n\u2013 if you want these credentials, this is what you have to do and this is what you have to endure.31\nThis is unthinkable within Nishnaabeg intelligence. In fact, if there isn\u2019t a considerable amount\nof demonstrated interest and commitment on the part of the learner, learning doesn\u2019t occur at all.\nRaising Indigenous children in a context where their consent, physically and intellectually, is not\njust required but valued, goes a long way to undoing the replication of colonial gender violence.\nIn the context of resurgence, which is an emergent process mitigated by spiritual forces,\nphysical and intellectual engagement with the struggle of nation-building within specific cultural\ncontexts is the only way to generate new knowledge. True engagement requires consent. Being\nengaged in the physical, real-world work of resurgence, movement-building and nation-building\n31 I would add that this context was one of real and symbolic normalized violence for many Indigenous women and\nqueer scholars coming through the system between 1960s and the 1990s. \u201cIndigenizing the academy\u201d at this stage\nmeant individual sacrifice for Indigenous women in order to obtain the credentials necessary to make the academy\nless violent towards the next group of Indigenous people coming through this system. It saddens me that these\nindividual sacrifices so often go unrecognized.16 L. Simpson\nis the only way to generate new knowledge on how to resurge from within Nishnaabeg\nintellectual systems - deep, consensual engagement with Nishnaabeg processes. We cannot just\nthink, write or imagine our way to a decolonized future. Answers on how to re-build and how to\nresurge are therefore derived from a web of consensual relationships that is infused with\nmovement (kinetic) through lived experience and embodiment. Intellectual knowledge is not\nenough on its own. Neither is spiritual knowledge or emotional knowledge. All kinds of\nknowledge are important and necessary in a communal and emergent balance.\nThis creation story also emphasizes that Nishnaabeg people embody all the necessary\nknowledge for resurgence. We are enough because if we are living our lives out in a Nishnaabeg\nway (and there are many of these ways) we can access all the knowledge that went into creating\nthe universe. In the face of ongoing settler-colonialism, my experience as an Nishnaabeg person\nengaging with centuries of gendered violence and the ongoing occupation of my homeland, part\nof my knowledge base is both a critical attunement to settler colonialism and generated theories\nof resistance, as well as resurgence and liberation, both from within my own knowledge system\nand through the sharing of the liberatory politics of Indigenous peoples and other communities of\nstruggle who have also been forced to live through oppression. Aki is also liberation and freedom\n- my freedom to establish and maintain relationships of deep reciprocity within a pristine\nhomeland that my ancestors handed down to me. Aki is encompassed by freedom, a freedom that\nis protected by sovereignty and actualized by self-determination.\nOnce this context is re-established, even if it begins as only a dream or a vision, even if it\njust by a few individuals, the fetishization of theoretical approaches32 to realize that context\nbecomes counter-productive. If bell hooks or Franz Fanon speaks to my heart as an\nNishnaabekwe, as both do, then Nishnaabeg intelligence compels me to learn, share and embody\neverything I can from every teacher that presents themselves to me. Nishnaabeg intelligence is\ndiversity - Nishnaabeg intelligence as diversity.33\nNanabush. Period.\nNanabush is widely regarded within Nishnaabeg thought as Spiritual Being and an important\nteacher because Nanabush mirrors human behavior and models how (and how not to) to come to\nknow. I think it\u2019s important to point out that Nanabush does not teach at a university, nor is\nNanabush a teacher within the state school system. Nanabush also doesn\u2019t read academic papers\nor write for Decolonization, Indigeneity, Education & Society. Nanabush is fun, entertaining,\nsexy, and playful. You\u2019re more likely to find Nanabush dancing on a table at a bar than at an\nacademic conference. If Nanabush had gone to teacher\u2019s college, Nanabush would have been\n32 I began to think about this more clearly after a discussion with activist Jaggi Singh around tactics in social\nmovements, in St. John\u2019s, NL, May 14, 2014.\n33 This is another idea that I learned from Manulani Meyer between 2012 and 2014 in Peterborough, Ontario and\nVancouver, BC.Land as pedagogy 17\nfired in the first three months of his first teaching gig.34 This is precisely why Nanabush is an\noutstanding teacher \u2013 Nanabush not only teaches me self compassion for the part of me that may\ndance on bars in celebration of life and love and all things good, but Nanabush comes with\ninevitable contradictions held within the lives of the occupied. Nanabush also continually shows\nus what happens when we are not responsible for our own baggage or trauma or emotional\nresponses. The brilliance of Nanabush is that Nanabush stories the land with a sharp criticality\nnecessary for moving through the realm of the colonized into the dreamed reality of the\ndecolonized, and for navigating the lived reality of having to engage with both at the same time.\nIn the spirit of Nanabush, part of me is being facetious with that last paragraph and part\nof me is not. The academic industrial complex does not and cannot provide the proper context\nfor Nishnaabeg intelligence without the full, valued recognition of the context within which\nNishnaabeg intelligence manifests itself \u2013 the practice of aki - freedom, sovereignty and self-\ndetermination over bodies, minds and land. The academy does not and cannot provide the proper\ncontext for Nishnaabeg intelligence without taking a principled stand on the forces that are\ncurrently attacking Nishnaabeg intelligence: colonial gendered violence, dispossession, erasure\nand imposed poverty. The academy does not and cannot provide the proper context for\nNishnaabeg intelligence without the full recognition of the system that generates this intelligence\nand the people that have dedicated their lives to growing, nurturing and living that system \u2013 our\nElders and knowledge holders. The academy does not and cannot provide the proper context for\nNishnaabeg intelligence without fully funding the re-generation of Indigenous thinkers as a\nmatter of restitution for the on-going damage it has caused and continues to cause Indigenous\nKnowledge system through centuries of out right attack (Smith, 2012).\nIf I imagine myself talking post-secondary education with Nanabush right now, it begins\nwith him immediately asking me why I think spending 60 hours a week indoors in a classroom\nor on a computer is Indigenous education at all. Point taken. I\u2019ve just spent several hours writing\nall of this down when my ancestors have always understood this and, in fact, I think my kids\nunderstand most of it. Several Nishnaabeg Elders are embodying all of these teachings right now,\nand any Indigenous person with motivation to learn to think inside the land should be interacting\nwith their own Elders and experts in their own homelands instead of reading me. So while I\ncould ask Nanabush what Nishnaabeg education is, I\u2019d have to be ready for him to flip the table.\nHe\u2019s not known for his patience for one thing, and for another he\u2019s spent eternity trying to\ndemonstrating how to teach, and more often how not to teach, within the context of his own life.\nIt\u2019s not Nanabush\u2019s fault we aren\u2019t paying attention.\nOne person who is paying attention is Kwezens, because in going back to the sugar bush\nKwezens models her day on an important Nanabush story. Shortly after the creation of the world\nand the birth of Nanabush, Nanabush took a trip around the world as a way of learning about the\nworld. That\u2019s the first lesson. If you want to learn about something, you need to take your body\n34 See John Borrow\u2019s conceptualization of Nanabush (Nanaboozhoo) in his story Maajitaadaa: Nanaboozhoo and\nthe Flood, Part 2 (Borrows, 2013); and Neal McLeod\u2019s discussion in Cree Narrative Memory (2007, p. 99).18 L. Simpson\nonto the land and do it. Get a practice.35 If you want to learn about movement building, get\nyourself outside involved with people that are building movements. That doesn\u2019t mean don\u2019t\nread books, or don\u2019t talk to people with all kinds of intelligences. It doesn\u2019t mean don\u2019t find\nmentors. It does mean, get out, get involved and get invested. After Nanabush had completed his\nfirst journey around the world, he embarked on a second journey around the world, this time with\nwolf as a companion. At this point, we should all recognize pretty clearly that the learning\nchanges when the relational context changes. Nanabush did a tremendous amount of visiting on\nboth of his trips \u2013 he visited with Nokomis, he visited with the West Wind, he visited with plants\nand animals, mountains, and bodies of water. Visiting within Nishnaabeg intelligence means\nsharing oneself through story, through principled and respectful consensual reciprocity with\nanother living being. Visiting is lateral sharing in the absence of coercion and hierarchy, and in\nthe presence of compassion. Visiting is fun, enjoyable, nurturing of intimate connections and\nrelationship building. Visiting is the core of our political system (leaders visiting with all the\nmembers of the community), our mobilization (Tkamse36 and Pontiac visited within and outside\nof their own nations for several years before they expected mobilization), and our intelligence\n(people visiting Elders, sharing food, taking care). Kwezens knew this. This is why she was\nvisiting the maple tree in the first place.\nAt several points in Nanabush\u2019s journey, Nanabush sought spiritual guidance through\ndreams, visions and ceremonies. At one point he had to learn to build a canoe to cross a large\nbody of water \u2013 he experimented until he figured it out. This was both time consuming and\nfrustrating. When he finally got a structure that would float, he had no way to propel it. This was\nalso time consuming and frustrating. Eventually, by calming down and watching a beaver, he\nwas able to fashion a paddle inspired by the beaver\u2019s tail and continue across the body of water.\nIn this story, Nanabush models how to come to know for Kwezens. He shows us land as\npedagogy, without yelling \u201cLAND AS PEDAGOGY,\u201d or typing land as pedagogy into a\ncomputer 50 times. Sometimes when I am teaching PhD students, I say that in this story\nNanabush is teaching us how to be students, teachers, and researchers \u2013 he is giving us theory\nand methodology, but it\u2019s really much bigger then that. Nanabush is teaching us how to be full\nhuman beings within the context of Nishnaabeg intelligence. Nishnaabeg intelligence is for\neveryone, not just students, teachers and researchers. It\u2019s not just pedagogy; it\u2019s how to live life.\n35 Manulani Meyer came to a PhD class in Indigenous Studies at Trent University in 2012 that I was teaching on\nmethodology and theory. She began by asking students not what their dissertation was about, or their theoretical\nframework, or their methodological approach, but she instead asked what their practice was in the context of\nIndigenous Knowledge. This is critical distinction.\n36 Tkamse and Taagaamose are Anishinaabeg names meaning Tecumseh. Taagaamose comes from Dr.\nTobasanakwet Kinew and is used with the permission of his son, Wab Kinew. I learned the word Tkamse and its\nmeaning from Anishinaabe scholar Brock Pitawanakwat. Both Taagaamose and Tkamse have the same meaning as\nthe Shawnee \u201cTecumseh\u201d, but are different dialects of the Nishnaabe language.Land as pedagogy 19\nNishnaabeg intelligence as resurgence\nBeing engaged in land as pedagogy as a life practice inevitably means coming face-to-face with\nsettler colonial authority, surveillance and violence because, in practice, it places Indigenous\nbodies between settlers and their money (Coulthard, 2, p.36). The practices of hunting, fishing\nand living off the land within my territory are a direct challenge to settler colonialism since 1923\nand the imposition of the Williams Treaty (Blair, 2008). Being a practitioner of land as pedagogy\nand learning in my community also means learning how to resist this imposition, it\u2019s a process of\nlearning how to be on the land anyway.\nThere are countless stories that I could tell here about settler surveillance, criminalization,\nand violence that occurs on the land while Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg are engaged as\npractitioners in Nishnaabewin,37 but the story I want to leave you with is one that comes from\nsomeone who has invested a large amount of time in my intelligence as an Nishnaabekwe.38\nOver the past fifteen years or so, I have spent a large amount of time on the land learning\nfrom Curve Lake Elder Doug Williams. Doug and I have hunted, fished, trapped, picked\nmedicines, conducted ceremonies, harvested birch bark, made maple syrup, canoed ancient\nroutes and harvested wild rice throughout our territory. This represents the most profound\neducational experience of my life and I hope that it is far from over. During our extensive time\non our land, Doug has taught me the history of Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg, an oral tradition\npassed down to him from his uncles, who would have learned it from their parents and\ngrandparents. He has taught me the political traditions of our people, and the ceremonies,\nphilosophies and values that they carried with them. He has taken me to every sacred sight in our\nterritory and shared songs, seamlessly moving between the roles of best friend, father and Elder.\nHe has patiently listened to me. He has patiently answered every question I\u2019ve brought to him.\nHe has told me hundreds of stories cataloguing the fierce resistance of our ancestors to our way\nof life. He has healed me.\nIt is this relationship, more than any other, which has created in me the same fierce\nresistance my ancestors carried with them, that has fostered in me a responsibility to our\nterritory. It is this relationship, more than any other, that has made me Michi Saagiig\nNishnaabeg. Doug has invested more time in my spiritual, emotional and intellectual education\nthan anyone else in my life. Yet it is completely unrecognized, unsupported and disregarded by\nacademic institutions.\nBeing out on the land with Doug, living our Michi Saagiig Nishnaabewin, means we run\nup against colonial authorities on a regular basis, whether that is the police, game wardens or\nsettlers providing their own home grown surveillance for the settler colonial authorities. To be\nhonest, most of this is fairly normalized and unless there is a particular aggression or violence to\n37 For one example see http://decolonization.wordpress.com/2012/12/21/aambe-maajaadaa-what-idlenomore-means-\nto-me/\n38 Ojibwe woman20 L. Simpson\nthe incident, I often don\u2019t even notice. But Doug reminds me continually through story that being\ntied to land also means being tied to an unwritten, unseen history of resistance:\nThe 1923 Williams Treaty was devastating to my people. I witnessed the trauma\nand the fear that was put on my people that were trying to live on the land. They\nlived daily watching over their backs and trying to maintain their lifestyle as Michi\nSaagiig Nishnaabeg. The government with the implementation of the \u201cbasket\nclause\u201d39 was a sneaky way to get rid of us as people who enjoyed this part of our\ngreat land. These old men I hung around with such as Madden and Jimkoons\nTaylor lived a life where they had to live by sneaking around and feeling like they\nwere \u201cpoachers.\u201d They resorted to catching other animals and harvesting those\nthings that the government did not feel were part of the things they need to\n\u201cprotect\u201d from us. These things included small animals, such as the ground hog\nand the porcupine, the muskrat for meat and other things were also eaten because\nwe were forbidden from hunting deer (which was our staple). Michi Saagiig\nNishnaabeg were also prohibited from fishing from October 15 to July 1 every\nyear under provincial statues. These colonial restrictions were devastating to\npeople that lived on the land. They posted Game Wardens in the tri-lakes area \u2013\nBuckhorn, Chemong and Pigeon to enforce these restrictions. We faced starvation.\nIt was particularly difficult to obtain food in the winter-time and since fishing was\nprohibited it became a time of great suffering. People had to run up an account at\nthe Whetung General Store to tie them over until the muskrat season opened in\nApril. So it was November to April that was quite difficult. Some people still had to\nfish and would do it at odd hours and would have to sneak around and not be seen.\nThis is a very difficult thing to do in the winter. Anyone standing on the ice can be\nseen for miles and this is what the Game Warden would look out for and go out\nand chase my people. There were many stories told of how my people escaped the\nGame Warden. There were many stories of our people being caught, and going to\ncourt in Peterborough to be given fines for fishing out of season. Imagine the\nindignity on our people when they came in front of the Canadian courts for being\nMichi Saagiig Nishnaabeg in our own territory!\nOur people were incredibly strong and resilient. We were able to survive even\nthough we were forced to live in an undignified way of living off the land. There is\na story told of one of the young men \u2013 Shkiin, short for Shkiininini meaning young\nman. Shkiin had the ability to escape the Game Warden by putting on these skates\nyou tied onto your feet. The only problem was there was the skates had no brakes,\nso it was impossible to stop. One day, the Game Warden showed up with modern\ntube type skates. He saw Shkiin fishing out on the ice, put on those speed skating\nskates and went after Shkiin. Shkiin tied on his skates and took off. After awhile,\nthe Game Warden started to catch up. Shkiin thought, \u201cuh oh I\u2019m in trouble.\u201d Just\nthen he saw some open water. He thought he would skate as fast as he could and\n39 The basket clause was a legal clause added after the treaty was negotiated that negated all other treaties Michi\nSaagiig Nishnaabeg had signed with the Crown. It is our belief that this clause was added after negotiations were\ncomplete without the knowledge of our leaders. See Blair (2008).Land as pedagogy 21\njump over the open water because he knew the Game Warden couldn\u2019t follow. So\nhe skated as fast as he could, took the leap, it was about 20 feet and he made it. He\nlanded, looked around and the Game Warden had to put on the breaks. Shkiin\nturned around, waved at him and gave him that Saasaakwe sound. The old people\nused to tell about that story and how Shkiin became a legend in getting away from\nGame Wardens.\nI admire the resilience of my people very much. One of the ways they kept up their\nspirit was with humour. Many stories are told of the clutzy Game Wardens that\nwere posted on the lakes to watch out for us. There are also some sad stories. Old\nSam Fawn after many years of carving axe handles, saving up money and making\nother items like that. With his little bit of money he was able to afford a cedar strip\ncanoe from Peterborough. He went fishing on Fox Island out of provincial season.\nHe was seen by the Game Warden who chased him. Sam beat him and came across\nform Fox Island to the mainland at Curve Lake. He put his canoe up on shore,\nturned it over and walked home. Everyone did that back in those days. Everyone\nknew each other canoes. The Game Warden was watching him from Fox Island,\nand he sneaked over and seized that canoe. The canoe has never been seen again.\nPoor Sam Fawn, worked hard his whole life, trying to live off the land. I remember\nhim as being one of the most gentle human beings that lived in Curve Lake. The\ntrauma created by the 1923 Williams Treaty will be longed lived. It lives in our\nhearts. The government can never repay us for what the damage they have caused.\nThe damage is done. Many of the people that lived through this trauma have now\npassed on. I remember them dearly and I hope that somehow there are no Game\nWardens in the Happy Hunting Grounds. (Williams, 2013)\nThis story serves as an important reminder: by far the largest attack on Indigenous Knowledge\nsystems right now is land dispossession, and the people that are actively protecting\nNishnaabewin are not those at academic conferences advocating for its use in research and\ncourse work but those that are currently putting their bodies on the land. In many ways, the fight\nfor Nishnaabewin is not taking place in Parliament, on social media, or on the streets in urban\ncentres; rather, it lies with communities like Grassy Narrows, and those on the ground who are\nactive practitioners of Nishnaabewin or who are actively protecting their lands from destruction.\nWhen I was a PhD student at the University of Manitoba in the late 1990s, there was a\nconsiderable amount of discussion amongst academics on how to ethically and responsibly bring\nIndigenous Knowledge into the academy, as a way of legitimizing the knowledge of Indigenous\npeoples as an intellectual system on par with western traditions, as a mechanism to attract\nIndigenous students to the academy, and as mechanism to preserve Indigenous Knowledges\n(Simpson, 2008). An effort was made to produce more Indigenous scholars as a mechanism for\nhaving a stronger presence within the colonial system. When I first held a tenure track position in\nan Indigenous Studies Department, there were two Elders on faculty, both women, who had\ngained tenure on the basis of their expertise in Indigenous Knowledge, not on western22 L. Simpson\ncredentials. Fifteen years later, the same university has no tenured Elders, only Indigenous and\nnon-Indigenous academics primarily hired on the basis of western credentials.\nThe problem with this approach then, and now, is that it reinforces colonial authority over\nNishnaabeg intelligence by keeping it reified and fetishized within a settler colonial approach to\neducation designed only to propel settler colonialism. This serves to reinforce asymmetrical\npower relationships between Indigenous Knowledge and western knowledge, and Indigenous\nand non-Indigenous peoples. It sets both Indigenous Knowledge Holders and Indigenous learners\nup in a never-ending battle for recognition within that system, when the academy\u2019s primary\nintention is to use Indigenous peoples and our knowledge systems to legitimize settler colonial\nauthority within education as a training ground to legitimize settler colonial authority over\nIndigenous peoples and our nations in Canadian society40.\nNishnaabeg must stop looking for legitimacy within the colonizer\u2019s education system and\nreturn to valuing and recognizing our individual and collective intelligence on its own merits and\non our own terms. Withdrawing our considerable collective efforts to \u201cIndigenize the academy\u201d,\nin favor of a resurgence of Indigenous intellectual systems and a reclamation of the context\nwithin which those systems operate, goes much further to propelling our nationhood and re-\nestablishing Indigenous political systems because it places people back on the land in a context\nthat is conducive to resurgence and mobilization. The academy has continually proven its refusal\nto recognize and support the validity, legitimacy, rigor and ethical principles of Nishnaabeg\nintelligence and the system itself, so we must stop begging for recognition and do this work for\nourselves. This colonial refusal should be met with Indigenous refusal \u2013 refusal to struggle\nsimply for better or more inclusion and recognition within the academic industrial complex.41 As\nMartineau and Ritskes (2014) state in their discussion of decolonial aesthetics, \u201cThis means the\ntask of decolonial artists, scholars and activists is not simply to offer amendments or edits to the\ncurrent world, but to display the mutual sacrifice and relationality needed to sabotage colonial\nsystems of thought and power for the purpose of liberatory alternatives (p. II). This is true in\npolitics, art, cultural and intellectual production, and education because these systems are\nseamlessly woven together within our intelligence.\nIf the academy is concerned about not only protecting and maintaining Indigenous\nintelligence, but revitalizing it on Indigenous terms as a form of restitution for its historic and\ncontemporary role as a colonizing force (of which I see no evidence), then the academy must\nmake a conscious decision to become a decolonizing force in the intellectual lives of Indigenous\npeoples by joining us in dismantling settler colonialism and actively protecting the source of our\nknowledge - Indigenous land.\nI am not saying that Indigenous peoples should forgo learning western based skills, but\nwe currently have a situation where our greatest minds, our children and youth, are spending 40\n40 For a broader discussion see (Coulthard, 2014b; Smith, 2011; and Nadasdy, 2003)\n41 For a discussion of Native Studies in the context of the academic industrial complex see Smith (2011). For a\nbroader discussion on Indigenous recognition in Canadian politics see Coulthard (2014b), and for a discussion of the\npolitics of refusal see Audra Simpson (2014).Land as pedagogy 23\nhours a week in state run education systems, from age 4 to 22 if they complete an undergraduate\ndegree. Next to none of that takes place in an Nishnaabeg context and although many Indigenous\nparents and families do everything that can do to ensure their children are connected to their\nhomelands, this should be the centre of the next generation\u2019s lives, not the periphery. In order to\nfoster expertise within Nishinaabeg intelligence, we need people engaged with land as\ncurriculum and engaged in our languages for decades, not weeks. Shouldn\u2019t we, as communities,\nsupport and nurture children that choose to only educate themselves within Nishnaabewin?\nWouldn\u2019t this create a strong generation of Elders? Don\u2019t we deserve learning spaces where we\ndo not have to address state learning objectives, curriculum, credentialism and careerism, where\nour only concern for recognition comes from within? Is the state run education system and the\nacademic industrial complex really a house worth inhabiting (Mignolo, in Gaztambide-\nFern\u00e1ndez, 2014, p. 204)?\nNishnaabewin did not and does not prepare children for successful career paths in a hyper\ncapitalistic system. It is designed to create self-motivated, self-directed, community-minded,\ninter-dependent, brilliant, loving citizens, who at their core uphold our ideals around family,\ncommunity and nationhood by valuing their intelligences, their diversity, their desires and gifts\nand their lived experiences. It encourages children to find their joy and place it at the centre of\ntheir lives. It encourages children to value consent. This was the key to building nations where\nexploitation was unthinkable. But don\u2019t our children have to live in a hyper capitalistic system?\nWell, yes; and if we are going to survive this as Nishnaabeg, we need to create generations of\npeople that are capable of actualizing radical decolonization, diversity, transformation and local\neconomic alternatives to capitalism.\nThe beauty of culturally inherent resurgence is that it challenges settler colonial\ndissections of our territories and our bodies into reserve/city or rural/urban dichotomies. All\nCanadian cities are on Indigenous lands. Indigenous presence is attacked in all geographies. In\nreality, the majority of Indigenous peoples move regularly through reserves, cities, towns and\nrural areas. We have found ways to connect to the land and our stories and to live our\nintelligences no matter how urban or how destroyed our homelands have become. While it is\ncritical that we grow and nurture a generation of people that can think within the land and have\ntremendous knowledge and connection to aki, this doesn\u2019t have to take away from the\ncontributions of urban Indigenous communities to our collective resurgence. Cities have\nbecomes sites of tremendous activism and resistance, and artistic, cultural and linguistic revival\nand regeneration, and this too comes from the land. Whether urban or rural, city or reserve, the\nshift that Indigenous systems of intelligence compel us to make is one from capitalistic consumer\nto cultural producer. Kwezens reminds me that, \u201cThe freedom realized through flight and refusal\nis the freedom to imagine and create an elsewhere in the here; a present future beyond the\nimaginative and territorial bounds of colonialism. It is a performance of other worlds, an\nembodied practice of flight (Martineau and Ritskes, 2014, p. IV). For me, seeing Kwezens as\nfugitive provides the fire, the compassion and the loving rebellion to do just that.24 L. Simpson\nReferences\nAlfred, T. (2005).

The land makes people live right.\nThe land looks after us. The land looks after people.\n-Annie Peaches quoted in Basso, Wisdom Sits in Places, 1995\nThis special issue features new empirical and conceptual studies that suggest a\nrange of considerations and practices of land education. In examining and articulat-\ning land education, the authors in the issue discuss both the role of Indigenous cos-\nmologies in practices of land education, as well as the necessity of centering\nhistorical and current contexts of colonization in education on and in relation to\nland. In particular, the issue focuses on land education in relation to settler colonial\nterritories: that is, in territory that is Indigenous and which has been and continues\nto be subject to the forces of colonization through land-based settlement (e.g. the\nUS, Australia, and Brazil). The articles in the special issue delineate how the ongo-\ning colonization of land and peoples are in fact embedded within educators\u2019 and\nresearchers\u2019 practices and understandings of (environmental) education around the\nglobe. Thus, the audience for this special issue includes all practitioners and\nresearchers concerned with education and, in this venue, specifically those con-\ncerned with environment and education.\nThe special issue also arises as a conversation in relation to the building\nmomentum of place-based education, including how it has been mobilized within\nthe field of environmental education. In part inspired by a recognition that the spe-\ncifics of geography and community matter for how (environmental) education can\nand should be engaged, place-based forms of education are steadily evolving with\nincreasing curricular uptake and empirical research. Many authors in the current\ncollection, however, draw attention to concerns with place-based and other forms\nof environmental education that position themselves as culturally or politically neu-\ntral while perpetuating forms of European universalism (Mignolo 2003) and settler\ncolonialism, including understandings of Indigenous peoples as repositories of static\nforms of cultural knowledge (Friedel 2011).\nIn this introductory essay we will elaborate on these themes after providing an\noverview of the nine pieces included in the issue. The articles in this collection\nwere selected from among those that were submitted in response to an open call\nfor articles on the topic of \u2018Land education: Indigenous, post-colonial, and decolo-\nnizing perspectives on place and environmental education research.\u2019 The majority\nof articles are written on or in relation to land located in the US (e.g. New York,\nIllinois, Virginia, Hawaii, California, Alaska, and cross-state), as well as one paper\nabout Australia and one about Brazil. Authors cross nations in their origins, loca-\ntions, and writing focus. Many of the articles\u2019 authors belong to Indigenous nations\n\u00a92014Taylor&Francis\n4102\nhcraM\n90\n40:80\nta\n]322.342.71.17[\nyb\ndedaolnwoD2 Editorial\n(Ojibwe, Lakota, Choctaw, Little Shell Band of Chippewa-Cree, Miami, Din\u00e9,\nincluding others). In other cases, authors based in Canada write mainly about\nevents in Alaska (Korteweg and Oakley); authors writing on the Australian curricu-\nlum reside in Australia and Canada (Whitehouse et al.); authors writing about an\nAfrican-centered curriculum write in the context of the US (Engel Di-Mauro and\nCarroll).\nWhile topical themes of similarity and divergence crisscross the articles, the first\nhalf of the issue features articles on the possibilities of land education in relation to\nparticular disciplinary and formal education domains: of K-12 social studies educa-\ntion (Calderon), K-12 science education (Bang et al.), K-12 cross-curricular educa-\ntion (Whitehouse et al.), and Africana Studies and Geography post-secondary\neducation courses (Engel di-Mauro and Carroll). The remaining articles focus on\neducation more generally and/or in relation to popular and non-formal contexts,\nand are grouped together because they offer more specific examples of land educa-\ntion pedagogy at work: through historical analysis (McCoy), food sovereignty\n(Meyer), social mapping (Sato et al.), critical cartography and ethnography (Paper-\nson), and film analysis (Korteweg and Oakley). The range of research and teaching\nmethodologies represented here is also of note \u2013 including social mapping, critical\ncartography, ethnography, historical analysis, community-based design research,\ndocument and film analysis, and conceptual essay, and will be discussed further\ntowards the end of the introduction.\nThough some may attempt to dismiss discussions of settler colonialism as\noverly concerned with the past, settler colonialism is important to analyze because\nit \u2018relies upon assumptions about other cultures that are alive and well in the most\npowerful societies in the contemporary world\u2019 (Hinkson 2012, 1). As Indigenous\n(Eve Tuck) and non-Indigenous (Kate McCoy and Marcia McKenzie) co-editors of\nthe issue, writing from settler colonial countries of the US and Canada, we\nembarked on editing this special issue because of our commitment to the issues dis-\ncussed herein. Bridging fields and considerations of settler colonial studies, Indige-\nnous studies, and environmental education is a challenging but necessary task, and\nwe appreciate the work of the authors and readers of this issue towards furthering\nthe important considerations and practices discussed in this collection. As Calderon\n(this issue) outlines, the intersections of environmentalism and Indigenous rights\nhave long been articulated by Indigenous communities, scholars, activists, and\nallies, with recent global Indigenous social movements demanding broader dialog\nand action on these intersections. This issue contributes to these intentions, suggest-\ning why and how education, including environmental education, might better\naccount for the history, present, and future by attending to its embedded issues of\ncolonialism and Indigenous rights and sovereignty.\nOverview of the articles\nThe first four articles of the special issue discuss and provide examples of land\neducation in the context of K-12 education (social studies education, science\neducation, and cross-curricular), post-secondary education, and community-based\neducation. In the first article, \u2018Speaking back to Manifest Destinies: a land educa-\ntion-based approach to critical curriculum inquiry,\u2019 Dolores Calderon suggests how\nland education can move place-based education forward, \u2018especially its potential\nfor centering indigeneity and confronting educational forms of settler colonialism\u2019\n4102\nhcraM\n90\n40:80\nta\n]322.342.71.17[\nyb\ndedaolnwoDEnvironmental Education Research 3\n(24). She outlines how through the US social studies curriculum, K-12 schooling\ntransmits a settler colonial land ethic and suggests that a limitation of much\nplace-based education has been a lack of meaningful engagement of such colonial\nlegacies in education, including through conceptualizations of place. Land educa-\ntion, according to Calderon, should involve an analysis of territoriality and settler\ncolonialism; center Indigenous realities (e.g. include a history of the land as Indige-\nnous, require that Indigenous peoples lead discussions regarding land education in\ncommunities, and be infused with Indigenous metaphysics); and destabilize the\nfocus on local (i.e. acknowledge how global histories and broader ideologies shape\nthe local). Building on the language of \u2018decolonization\u2019 and \u2018reinhabitation\u2019 used in\nmuch recent place-based work (Gruenewald 2003), Calderon emphasizes that \u2018land\neducation takes up what place-based education fails to consider: the ways in which\nplace is foundational to settler colonialism\u2019 (33). She suggests that environmental\neducation has an overdue responsibility to make visible and begin to address the\nassumptions of settler colonialism within the field.\nThe second article by Megan Bang, Lawrence Curley, Adam Kessel, Ananda\nMarin, Eli Suzukovich III, and George Strack is titled \u2018Muskrat theories, tobacco in\nthe streets, and living Chicago as Indigenous land.\u2019 Framed in relation to science\neducation as environmental education, Bang and colleagues offer powerful descrip-\ntions and examples of \u2018urban Indigenous land-based pedagogies\u2019 (39). The authors\nadvocate for the necessity of science education given current socio-scientific reali-\nties (such as climate change) that are shaping the land and the lives that the land\nsupports, including those of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. They\npropose science education as a site of potential transformation due to its relation-\nships to epistemologies and ontologies of land and Indigenous futurity. They\nsuggest, however, that achieving this potential requires \u2018desettling dynamics of set-\ntler colonialism that remain quietly buried in educational environments that engage\nlearning about, with and in the land and all of its dwellers\u2019 (39). Questioning the\npossibilities for Indigenous peoples in current forms of place-based education, Bang\net al. express concerns about the reification of western intellectual traditions. Their\narticle, in contrast, describes the theoretical and practical tools they developed to\ncollaborate with Native youth, families, and community members in relation to\nurban science and environmental learning environments in order to (re)story\nChicago as Indigenous lands. Informed by the work of Smith (1999), Bang and her\nco-authors aspire to \u2018work within a methodological paradigm of decolonization\u2019\n(39) in undertaking community-based design research. The article does important\ntheoretical work in enacting critical readings of place-based education that are\ninformed by settler colonial studies, establishing Indigenous presence in urban\neducational contexts, and disrupting settler zero point epistemologies \u2013 those episte-\nmologies that deny other perspectives and truths \u2013 in environmental education.\nChanging continents with \u2018Sea Country: navigating Indigenous and colonial\nontologies in Australian environmental education,\u2019 authors Hilary Whitehouse,\nFelecia Watkin Lui, Juanita Sellwood, Mary Jeanne Barrett, and Philemon Chigeza\nanalyze the positioning of Torres Strait Sea Country and Torres Strait Ailan Kastom\n(Island Custom) in relation to Australian K-12 environmental education curriculum\nand practice. Importantly, this paper identifies the ways that sea is part of \u2018land,\u2019\nand also embedded within cosmology and history (Styres, Haig-Brown, and\nBlimkie 2013). The authors provide a rich description of Indigenous Torres Strait\nIslanders\u2019 understandings of \u2018Sea Country,\u2019 as not categorized by a binary\n4102\nhcraM\n90\n40:80\nta\n]322.342.71.17[\nyb\ndedaolnwoD4 Editorial\nopposition between \u2018people\u2019 and \u2018environment,\u2019 but rather as a totality of complex\nrelationships. Likewise, Ailan Kaston, or native title derived from customary law,\nsets out particular relationships of connection with and care for the sea. The article\ndescribes how colonial settlement, supported by the \u2018legal fiction of terra nullius\u2019\n(61), introduced the concept of the sea as a public commons and the related\nimpacts on relationships and the \u2018management\u2019 of the area. Turning to the pedagog-\nical implications of and for Sea Country, the second half of the article exposes the\nways that Indigenous cosmology is simultaneously supported and ignored in the\ncross-curricular priorities in the first 11 years of the Australian national school\ncurriculum, including in the \u2018Sustainability\u2019 priority area.\nFocusing on post-secondary level classrooms in the US, Salvatore Engel-Di\nMauro and Karanja Keita Carroll offer \u2018An African-centered approach to land\neducation.\u2019 The paper discusses the role of the \u2018native-slave-settler triad\u2019 in the\nsettlement of the US and other settler colonial contexts (Wolfe 2006) and outlines\nthe necessity of also examining the history of chattel slaves (mostly from Africa)\nwho were kept landless and made into property along with Indigenous land as part\nof the settlement process in the US and elsewhere. Offering examples of place-based\nand environmental education that the authors find problematic, they suggest that\n\u2018Eurocentrism must be exploded at its roots,\u2019 with African-centered environmental\neducation curricula making contributions in this respect. They utilize examples from\nAfricana Studies and Geography to illustrate the contributions an African-centered\napproach can make to land education in the context of college-level environmental\neducation. Such an approach, the authors argue, promotes an integrative view of\nnature and people, histories, power relations, and community that can challenge\nsettler colonial assumptions that undergird much of environmental education.\nThe second half of the special issue is comprised of five articles that enact land\neducation through various types of analyses in particular locations. Kate McCoy\u2019s\narticle, \u2018Manifesting Destiny: a land education analysis of settler colonialism in\nJamestown, VA USA,\u2019 maps the discursive and material relations that produce(d)\nManifest Destiny and the settler colonial triad in the US. The paper outlines how\ndiscourses arising from the emerging modernism of seventeenth-century Protestant\nChristianity articulated a new interpretation of the creation story, calling for human\ndominion over the earth and its creatures. These and other discourses, McCoy\nsuggests, joined with the practices the English created as they established capitalist\nenterprise in what they called Jamestown, Virginia. Such enterprise included\ngrowing commercial tobacco for export, creating the material conditions and\njustifications for taking Indigenous land and introducing slavery. These discourses,\npractices, and relations, McCoy argues, established the settler colonial triad in the\nEnglish colonies that became known as the US. Settlers still undertake large-scale\nmonoculture and environmental degradation in areas around the globe and continue\nto cover their tracks using Manifest Destiny \u2013 in discourse, practice, and relation \u2013\nin the contemporary name of \u2018development\u2019 to justify settler colonialism past and\npresent. McCoy\u2019s study exemplifies how historical analysis of settler colonialism in\nthe US can inform land education and environmental education.\nIn \u2018Hoea Ea: land education and food sovereignty in Hawaii,\u2019 Manulani Meyer\nuses photographs and accompanying narratives to share two land education efforts\nin the Hawaiian Islands. In the Limahui valley in the ahupua\u2019a of H\u0101\u2019ena on the\nisland of Kauai, the ancient Hawaiian staple food taro (lo\u2019i kalo) is being grown\nutilizing traditional land, methods, and management practices (established\n4102\nhcraM\n90\n40:80\nta\n]322.342.71.17[\nyb\ndedaolnwoDEnvironmental Education Research 5\n700\u20131000years ago). It is used to sustainably feed a large population and honor\ntaro\u2019s cosmological role in Hawaiian origin stories. Meyer describes the methods\nused and their importance, highlighting the threat of encroachment as profit-driven\nsystems close in. The second photograph depicts the Kaiao Youth Community\nGarden in Hilo Ho\u2019ea, as part of a food sovereignty movement in Hawaii. She\ndescribes the history and aims of the project as it works to promote a native\nHawaiian view of land and sustenance as land education.\nA social mapping methodology for land education research and practice in\nsettler colonial Brazil is articulated by Mich\u00e8le Sato, Regina Silva, and Michelle\nJaber in their article \u2018Between the remnants of colonialism and the insurgence of\nself-narrative in constructing participatory social maps: towards a land education\nmethodology.\u2019 Sato and colleagues discuss maps as weapons of imperialism, but\nalso as tools that can be used to better understand settler colonialism, including its\nongoing effects on vulnerable communities. The article reports on a large-scale\nempirical study undertaken with 239 participants from diverse groups from the\nMato Grosso Region in Brazil, a territory initially colonized by the Portuguese.\nStudy data were gathered through interviews, discussions of mapped results, photo\nand video material, and participant observation, using a process of iterative\nmapping of participants\u2019 self-narratives. The authors suggest that this process is a\npowerful tool for land education in that it allows the mapping of social identities,\n\u2018recognizing land as an epistemological basis for understanding people\u2019s lives\u2019\n(108). They use the methodology to map the identities of vulnerable groups and\nthe social and environmental conflicts that affect them, in efforts to render these\ngroups and the challenges they face visible. In doing so, the project aims to con-\ntribute to responsive and participatory land and environmental policy, and provides\nan example of social mapping as environmental education.\nIn \u2018A ghetto land pedagogy: an antidote for settler environmentalism,\u2019 Paperson\ndraws on ethnographic research and historical analysis to provide a \u2018critical cartog-\nraphy\u2019 of the San Francisco Bay area of California. Weaving together stories of the\nhistories of Indigenous land and settlement, Paperson provides an unsettling land\neducation that examines the San Quentin prison, student responses to an Urban\nEcology lesson, and an analysis of the 2011 Occupy movement. Paperson charac-\nterizes the settler view of \u2018ghetto\u2019 land as terra sacer, the contemporary mutation\nof the colonial fiction of terra nullius or empty land that justifies the doctrine of\ncolonial discovery. Terra sacer is theorized as simultaneously sacred and accursed\nland, ripe for re-settling through gentrification, the way paved in part by environ-\nmental education that aims toward settler sustainability. In contrast, Paperson out-\nlines the ways that storied land can serve as \u2018an important connecting node\nbetween Indigenous struggle and black resistance\u2019 (126), and through the vignettes\nshared, outlines how youth and communities enact agency and resistance in the\nface of settler (and environmentalist) assumptions of land and occupation. Critiqu-\ning the language of \u2018reinhabitation\u2019 used in place-based education, Paperson works\nto exemplify the ways in which \u2018decolonization is not just symbolic; its material\ncore is repatriation of native life and land, which is incommensurable with settler\nre-inhabitation of native land\u2019 (124).\nFinally, Lisa Korteweg and Jan Oakley critically analyze the eco-heroic quest as\ndepicted in Hollywood movies in their article \u2018Eco-heroes out of place and rela-\ntions: decolonizing the narratives of Into the Wild and Grizzly Man through Land\neducation.\u2019 This kind of criticism, at the intersection of post-colonial/decolonizing\n4102\nhcraM\n90\n40:80\nta\n]322.342.71.17[\nyb\ndedaolnwoD6 Editorial\nmethodologies and Indigenous studies, gestures toward a land education critical of\nsuch representations and attentive to Indigenous stories and teachings of land\nalready in place in order to interrupt settler fantasies of becoming native. They pro-\npose to offer a counter-narrative of how environmental education might enter into\nmore respectful relations with Indigenous peoples in protecting Indigenous lands.\nThe paper also elaborates the ways in which \u2018environmental damage to the land/\nanimals (through resource extraction, animal extinction, land clearance, and pollu-\ntion) [is] intertwined inextricably with socio cultural genocide to the Indigenous\npeoples of the land\u2019 (132). The conflicting representations of the films\u2019 protagonists\nas offering both examples of \u2018good inhabitance\u2019 of place and at other times of\nbeing \u2018dangerously out of place\u2019 suggests the tensions in the aspirations of \u2018rein-\nhabitation through environmental place-based theories\u2019 on and in relation to Indige-\nnous land (140).\nKey contributions of the collection: descriptions and departures\nHaving provided a preliminary introduction to the various contributions of the\nissue, we now turn to drawing out further some of the key issues that are raised in\nthe articles. In particular, we elaborate on settler colonial studies as discussed in\nthe articles as central to land education, meanings of \u2018land\u2019 as mobilized in the\nissue, the agency in old and new movements to recognize land and Indigenous\nclaims to land, and the role of naming as part of land education. We conclude with\nsections addressing the question \u2018Why land education?\u2019 in relation to place-based\nand environmental education, and discussing modes and methodologies of what\ncounts as environmental education research.\nLand and settler colonialism\nTheories of colonialism have largely focused on what is sometimes called exoge-\nnous domination (Veracini 2011), exploitation colonialism, or external colonialism\n\u2013 three names for the same form. In this form of colonization, small numbers of\ncolonizers go to a new place in order to dominate a local labor force to harvest\nresources to send back to the metropole, for example the spice and opium trade that\nimpelled the colonization of India by several different European empires. Exploita-\ntion colonialism, its nature, consequences, endgame, and post-possibilities have\nbeen the focus of (what would become) the field of post-colonial studies for the\npast 50 years.\nIt has only been in the last two decades that settler colonialism has been more\ncomprehensively theorized, mostly via the emergence of the field of settler colonial\nstudies. As already indicated, settler colonialism is a form of colonization in which\noutsiders come to land inhabited by Indigenous peoples and claim it as their own\nnew home (see also Hinkson 2012). Subsequent generations of settlers come to the\nsettler nation-state for many reasons, under many circumstances \u2013 but at the heart\nof all of those rationales is the need for space and land. This form is distinct from\nthe exploitation colonialism that has been so deeply theorized in post-colonial stud-\nies, because, in settler colonialism, settlers come to the new land seeking land and\nresources, not (necessarily) labor (Wolfe 2011). Though there are many important\nparallels and connections between these forms of colonialism, especially as settler\ncolonial nation-states also occupy and colonize other lands, there are important\n4102\nhcraM\n90\n40:80\nta\n]322.342.71.17[\nyb\ndedaolnwoDEnvironmental Education Research 7\ndifferences to be teased apart (see also Hinkson 2012). For example, Veracini\n(2011) observes that exploitation colonizers and settler colonizers want very differ-\nent things: the exploitation colonizer says to the Indigenous person, \u2018you, work for\nme,\u2019 whereas the settler colonizer \u2013 because land is the primary pursuit \u2013 says to\nthe Indigenous person, \u2018you, go away\u2019 (1). Of course, in reality, settler colonizers\ncommunicate an amalgamation of these messages to Indigenous peoples; Veracini\nobserves that the accumulating sentiment may be more like, \u2018you, work for me\nwhile we wait for you to disappear,\u2019 or \u2018you, move on so you can work for me,\u2019\nbut the base intention of settlers has been to disappear Indigenous peoples from the\nland to make it available for settlement (2).\nOne of the notable characteristics of settler colonial states is the refusal to rec-\nognize themselves as such, requiring a continual disavowal of history, Indigenous\npeoples\u2019 resistance to settlement, Indigenous peoples\u2019 claims to stolen land, and\nhow settler colonialism is indeed ongoing, not an event contained in the past. Set-\ntler colonialism is made invisible within settler societies, and uses institutional\napparatuses to \u2018cover its tracks\u2019 (Veracini 2011). For example, most non-Indigenous\npeople living in settler societies, if they think of colonizers and/or settlers at all,\nthink of Captain James Cook, Christopher Columbus, colonies, and forts (Donald\n2012; see Hinkson 2012 for a discussion of the colonization of Australia). They\nthink of colonization as something that happened in the distant past, as perhaps the\nunfortunate birthpangs of a new nation. They do not consider the fact that they live\non land that has been stolen, or ceded through broken treaties, or to which Indige-\nnous peoples claim a pre-existing ontological and cosmological relationship.1 They\ndo not consider themselves to be implicated in the continued settlement and occu-\npation of unceded Indigenous land. Indeed, settler colonial societies \u2018cover\u2019 the\n\u2018tracks\u2019 of settler colonialism by narrating colonization as temporally located\nelsewhere, not here and now (Veracini 2011).\nAnother of the general characteristics of settler societies is that settlers are\nlocated at the top and at the center of all typologies \u2013 as simultaneously most\nsuperior and most normal (Tuck and Yang 2012). These typologies include settler/\nIndigenous, but also the hegemony of settlers over non-Indigenous workers. These\nhierarchies are established through force, policy, law, and ideology, and are so\nembedded that they become naturalized. Morgensen (2011) theorizes settler\ncolonialism as biopower, observing that \u2018the biopolitics of settler colonialism arose\nin the Americas by perpetuating African diasporic subjugation and Indigenous\nelimination simultaneously,\u2019 (57). Thus, in several contexts, settler colonialism has\nsimultaneously taken form as \u2018Slave estates\u2019 (Spillers 2003; Wilderson 2010)\nrequiring the forced labor of stolen peoples on stolen land. In these cases, settle-\nment require[d/s] the labor of chattel slaves and guest workers, who must be kept\nlandless and estranged from their homelands. For example, as detailed in Kate\nMcCoy\u2019s article in this special issue, Tsenecommacah peoples were killed,\ndisplaced, and otherwise removed from areas surrounding colonies in Virginia, as\nBlack men and women were brought from Africa to be bought and sold to labor\nthe land. Indeed, as discussed in several of the articles in the issue (Engel-Di\nMauro and Carroll, McCoy, Paperson), settler colonialism \u2018works\u2019 by making\nIndigenous land into property, and designating the bodies of slaves as property, or\nchattel (Tuck and Yang 2012). This same \u2018triad\u2019 dynamic continues to operate in\nNorth America and elsewhere in the working and living conditions of migrant\nworkers (Byrd 2011; Patel 2012).\n4102\nhcraM\n90\n40:80\nta\n]322.342.71.17[\nyb\ndedaolnwoD8 Editorial\nA final general characteristic of settler colonialism is its attempt (and failure) to\ncontain Indigenous agency and resistance. Indigenous peoples have refused settler\nencroachment, even while losing their lives and homelands. Writing about Aotearo-\na/New Zealand, Smith (2011) cites the long history of Maori resistance to settler\ninvasion, describing the settler nation\u2019s need to \u2018continually code, decode, and re-\ncode social norms and social spaces so as to secure a meaningful (read: proprie-\ntary) relationship to the territories and resources at stake\u2019 (112, parentheses\noriginal). Thus, when we theorize settler colonialism, we must attend to it as both\nan ongoing and incomplete project, with internal contradictions, cracks and fissures\nthrough which Indigenous life and knowledge have persisted and thrived despite\nsettlement.\nIn attending to these conditions of settler colonialism, land education calls into\nquestion educational practices and theories that justify settler occupation of stolen\nland, or encourage the replacement of Indigenous peoples and relations to land with\nsettlers and relations to property. The articles in this special issue instead seek to\nintervene upon settler colonialist narratives of land by refusing accounts of the past,\npresent, and future that are only accountable to settler futurities. That is, in land\neducation settler futurities are dislocated as the central referent for the effectiveness\nof an interpretation, the viability of a theory, or the possibility of reinvisionings or\nreimaginations. Instead, land education is accountable to Indigenous futurities, as is\ndiscussed further below.\nLand and Indigenous cosmologies\nA second key consideration of the special issue that we want to highlight is how\n\u2018land\u2019 is understood and engaged in the articles of the collection. These understand-\nings and practices draw on long and vibrant trajectories of Indigenous practice and\ntheory that understand land as encompassing all of the earth, including the urban,\nand as much more than just the material. In this section, we discuss these consider-\nations of land as they link to Indigenous cosmology and land education.\n\u2018Land\u2019 is used in the special issue as shorthand for land, water, air, and subter-\nranean earth \u2013 for example, in discussions of wetlands (Bang et al.) and Sea Coun-\ntry (Whitehorse et al.). Among Indigenous peoples, relationships to land and place\nare diverse, specific, and un-generalizable (Lowan 2009):\nEvery cultural group established their relations to [their place] over time. Whether that\nplace is in the desert, a mountain valley, or along a seashore, it is in the context of\nnatural community, and through that understanding they established an educational\nprocess that was practical, ultimately ecological, and spiritual. In this way they sought\nand found their life. (Cajete 1994, 113, as cited in Lowan 2009, 47)\n\u2018Land\u2019 is imbued with these long relationships and, as we discuss below, the peda-\ngogies and knowledges that have emerged from those relationships.\nSignificantly, authors in the collection also include the urban in their under-\nstandings and practices of land. Land and land education are not considered to\noccur only outside cities, or in \u2018green spaces\u2019 within the urban. Rather, several arti-\ncles focus specifically on urban land, making the case for the need for pedagogies\nthat examine and experience the urban as storied Indigenous land. In (re)storying\nChicago as Indigenous land through \u2018urban Indigenous land-based pedagogies,\u2019\n4102\nhcraM\n90\n40:80\nta\n]322.342.71.17[\nyb\ndedaolnwoDEnvironmental Education Research 9\nBang and colleagues write, \u2018A critical dimension of the work was making visible\nsettler colonial constructions of urban lands as ceded and no longer Indigenous\u2019\n(39). Likewise, Paperson (this issue) focuses on the urban context in hir discussion\nof \u2018ghetto colonialism\u2019 as an active specialization of settler colonialism in North\nAmerica and as an important focus for land education.\nAs Styres, Haig-Brown, and Blimkie (2013) recently articulated in discussing a\n\u2018pedagogy of Land,\u2019 (echoing Cajete 1994; Lowan 2009) \u2018land\u2019 refers not just to\nthe materiality of land, but also its \u2018spiritual, emotional, and intellectual aspects\u2019\n(37). These scholars choose to signify consideration of these aspects in their capi-\ntalization of Land (as do Korteweg and Oakley; and Engel-Di Mauro and Carroll,\nthis issue) and indicate they build on the work of Styres and Zinga (2013) in this\nrespect:\nWe have chosen to capitalize Land when we are referring to it as a proper name indi-\ncating a primary relationship rather than when used in a more general sense. For us,\nland (the more general term) refers to landscapes as a fixed geographical and physical\nspace that includes earth, rocks, and waterways; whereas, \u2018Land\u2019 (the proper name)\nextends beyond a material fixed space. Land is a spiritually infused place grounded in\ninterconnected and interdependent relationships, cultural positioning, and is highly\ncontextualized. (300\u2013301)\nThus, the word \u2018land\u2019 is also used in this special issue to convey these interwoven\ndimensions.\nRelational pedagogies of land are not new, as Bang and colleagues discuss in\ntheir article in this issue. They write,\nIndigenous scholars have focused much attention on relationships between land, epis-\ntemology and importantly, ontology. Places produce and teach particular ways of\nthinking about and being in the world. They tell us the way things are, even when\nthey operate pedagogically beneath a conscious level (44).\nOr, in other words, land can be considered as a teacher and conduit of memory\n(Brooks 2008; Wilson 2005), in that it \u2018both remembers life and its loss and serves\nitself as a mnemonic device that triggers the ethics of relationality with the sacred\ngeographies that constitute Indigenous peoples\u2019 histories\u2019 (Byrd 2011, 118).\nRelationships to land are familial, intimate, intergenerational, and instructive.\nFor example, special issue contributor Manulani Aluli Meyer writes elsewhere,\nLand is our mother. This is not a metaphor. For the Native Hawaiians speaking of\nknowledge, land was the central theme that drew forth all others. You came from a\nplace. You grew in a place and you had a relationship with a place. This is an episte-\nmological idea \u2026 One does not simply learn about land, we learn best from land.\n(2008, 219, italics original; ellipses inserted)\nLand teaches and can be considered as first teacher (Styres, Haig-Brown, and Blim-\nkie 2013). Yup\u2019ik scholar Angayuqaq Oscar Kawagley writes that for Yupiaq peo-\nple, land and nature are \u2018metaphysic\u2019 and pedagogical:\nIt is through direct interaction with the environment that the Yupiaq people learn.\nWhat they learn is mediated by the cultural cognitive map. The map consists of those\n\u2018truths\u2019 that have been proven over a long period of time. As the Yupiaq people\n4102\nhcraM\n90\n40:80\nta\n]322.342.71.17[\nyb\ndedaolnwoD10 Editorial\ninteract with nature, they carefully observe to find pattern or order where there might\notherwise appear to be chaos. (2010a, 88)\nHe continues, \u2018It was meaningless for Yupiaq to count, measure, and weigh, for\ntheir wisdom transcended the quantification of things to recognize a qualitative\nlevel whereby the spiritual, natural, and human worlds were inextricably intercon-\nnected\u2019 (90). Kawagley\u2019s rendering of Yupiaq relations to land braids together the\ncosmological, pedagogical, pragmatic, and spiritual.\nRelationships to land within Indigenous frameworks are not between owner\nand property, as typified in settler societies. As discussed in McCoy\u2019s paper in this\nissue, property is an enabling concept in a settler colonial framework, with property\nand property ownership being individualized. Instead, land is collective. Bang et al.\ninvoke Burkhart\u2019s (2004) revision of Descartes\u2019 insistence, \u2018I think, therefore I am,\u2019\nto \u2018We are, therefore I am,\u2019 to express the saliency of collectivity in Indigenous life\nand knowledge systems (this issue, 44). Bang et al. continue,\nSimilarly, we might imagine that ontology of place-based paradigms is something like\n\u2018I am, therefore place is,\u2019 in contrast, the ontology of land-based pedagogies might be\nsummarized as \u2018Land is, therefore we are.\u2019 (45)\nClearly, Bang et al. differentiate place-based education from land education because\nof the ontologies that animate them. Understandings of collectivity and shared\n(though not necessarily synchronous) relations to land are core attributes of land\neducation. Further \u2013 and this is not a romantic point \u2013 the land-we ontology articu-\nlated by Bang et al. is incommensurable with notions of ownership that are so inte-\ngral to notions of property.\nStyres, Haig-Brown, and Blimkie (2013), Meyer (2008), and Kawagley (2010a)\nand others also warn against understandings of Indigenous knowledge of land as\nstatic or performable. Calderon (this issue) emphasizes embracing protocols \u2018that\nare mindful of how Indigenous knowledge has been co-opted and omitted\u2019 (28),\nincluding for example expectations that Indigenous peoples lead discussions on\nland education. This mindfulness of co-option also entails an acknowledgment that\nIndigenous identities and knowledge are not static, and that non-Indigenous desires\nfor performances of \u2018authentic\u2019 Indigeneity are also problematic. Friedel (2011) out-\nlines this concern well in her paper on \u2018urban Native youth\u2019s cultured responses to\nWestern place-based learning\u2019 in western Canada. The youth in the study resisted\nthe stereotypes and expectations of the white educators for them to \u2018get back to\nnature,\u2019 instead holding fast to their own desires for social experiences and connec-\ntions, wanting to \u2018to learn to be Aboriginal without being in the woods\u2019 (535).\nFriedel (2011) writes:\nOf the pernicious representations of Indigeneity today, none is more equivocal than\nthe trope of \u2018the Ecological Indian.\u2019 Borne from nineteenth-century romantic primitiv-\nism, this White construction (Bird 1996) has become a prevalent signifier in the envi-\nronmental realm, an ideal to which Canadians and others look today for a critique of\nWestern institutions (534).\nAs this point suggests, mindfulness of non-Indigenous desires to access assumed\nIndigenous knowledge also needs to extend to a mindfulness of non-Indigenous\ndesires to adopt or use such knowledge (e.g. critiques of the formulations and uses\n4102\nhcraM\n90\n40:80\nta\n]322.342.71.17[\nyb\ndedaolnwoDEnvironmental Education Research 11\nof \u2018traditional ecological knowledge,\u2019 as in Agrawal 2002). This is difficult terrain\nin working both with Indigenous and non-Indigenous learners: to acknowledge and\ninclude Indigenous knowledge and perspectives but in non-determined ways that\ndo not stereotype Indigenous knowledge or identities. The creative resistance of\nstudents and instructors are perhaps the best teachers in walking this path (Bang\nthis issue; Paperson this issue; Friedel 2011; Styres, Haig-Brown, and Blimkie\n2013).\nLand and agency: Indigenous land rights and social movements\nIn addition to elaborating on the special issue themes of settler colonialism and\nIndigenous cosmologies in relation to land, we also want to highlight the themes of\nagency and resistance in relation to land education and environmental education\nmore broadly. The role of agency in environmental education can be manifested at\nthe level of participating students (e.g. Paperson\u2019s discussion of youth resistance to\neducators\u2019 expectations of white middle-class environmentalism or as in Friedel\u2019s\n2011 study discussed above), and a number of articles in the issue suggest forms of\nland education that are participatory and open-ended in ways that aim to center\nparticipant input and agency (e.g. Bang et al.; Sato, Silva and Jaber; Whitehouse\net al.).\nArticles in the special issue also highlight and exemplify agency and resistance\nthrough forms of land education that explicitly address settler colonialism in\nrelation to futurities of Indigenous land and life. Discussing \u2018organizing rooted in\nstorytelling,\u2019 Paperson provides a land-based ethnography of past and present\nIndigenous resistance to colonialism in the San Francisco Bay area. In contrast to\nnarrations of \u2018Indian resistance \u2026 as a lost cause of a vanishing race and dying\nculture\u2019 (125), Paperson highlights past and present circumstances of resistance as\nland education curriculum. Likewise, Sato, Silva, and Jaber (this issue) offer as\nland education the mapping and distribution of the stories of land-based exploita-\ntion and resistance within the Mato Grosso Region of Brazil. Thus, countering the\n\u2018institutionalization of territoriality in settler colonialism\u2019 (Calderon this issue, 30),\nauthors in the special issue offer compelling articulations and examples of agency\ntowards more ethical relations on and with land.\nThis work builds on existing trajectories of Indigenous resistance and movement\nbuilding. Describing a 1970 meeting of Indigenous scholars at Princeton,\nCook-Lynn (1997) writes that the participants asserted the foremost concerns of the\nthen-emerging field of Native American Studies as the \u2018defense of Indigenous land\nand rights\u2019 (9). Participants emphasized the \u2018endogenous study of First Nations cul-\ntures and history,\u2019 (11, italics original) that is, the study of Indigenous lives and\nissues by Indigenous peoples. Smith (1999/2013), Wilson (2008), Kovach (2010),\nand Chilisa (2011) describe corresponding central commitments within Indigenous\nstudies emerging in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and Botswana. Likewise, the\nintersections of environmentalism and Indigenous rights have long been articulated\nby Indigenous communities, activists and allies (Calderon, this issue). As discussed\nin several of the articles, Idle No More and prior global Indigenous social move-\nments have intensified the demands from Indigenous communities and allies for\ndialog and action on Indigenous land rights and sovereignty. Paperson theorizes\nhow these very concepts of rights, sovereignty, and justice take on significantly\ndivergent inflections in Indigenous movements and lexicons than in settler colonial\n4102\nhcraM\n90\n40:80\nta\n]322.342.71.17[\nyb\ndedaolnwoD12 Editorial\nlexicons: \u2018Aboriginal sovereignty is different from state sovereignty because it\nembraces diversity and focuses on inclusivity rather than exclusivity (Watson 2007,\n20, as quoted in Paperson, 123). As part of, and allied with, these trajectories and\nmovements, this special issue on land education prioritizes Indigenous theorizing,\nIndigenous land rights, and Indigenous sovereignty.\nThe significance of naming: language, thought, and land\nYup\u2019ik scholar Angayuqaq Oscar Kawagley said often that Mother Nature has a\nculture, and it is a Native culture (2010b). Connecting language and land,\nRasmussen and Akulukjuk (2009) insist that when discussing environmental\neducation, the crucial question is, what language does the environment speak? \u2018In\nNunavut,\u2019 the authors say, \u2018the land speaks Inuktitut\u2019 (285). By this they mean that\nthe land and sea have \u2018evolved\u2019 an Indigenous language to communicate with and\nthrough human beings, a language that \u2018grew in [an] area over thousands of years\nof interaction between the elements and the human and plant and animal beings\u2019\n(285). Noting that this point is likely obvious to Indigenous readers, they go on to\nassure those who view it as a \u2018dislocated phenomenon\u2019 that language is not\nsomething developed in isolation in human brains, but in relationship to land and\nwater (285).\nIn an example of the intimate relationships between land, language, and\nthought from Alaska, I\u00f1upiaq scholar Edna Ahgeak MacLean speaks to life in a\nworld that would appear to outsiders as barren and frozen:\nPeople use their language to organize their reality. I\u00f1upiaq and Yup\u2019ik cultures are\nbased on dependence on the land and sea. Hunting, and therefore a nomadic way of\nlife has persisted. The sea and land that people depend on for their sustenance are\nalmost totally devoid of landmarks. These languages have therefore developed an\nelaborate set of demonstrative pronouns and adverbs that are used to direct the lis-\ntener\u2019s attention quickly to the nature and location of an object. In place of landmarks,\nwords serve as indicators about proximity, visibility, or vertical position and implies\nwhether the object is inside or outside, moving or not moving, long or short. For\nexample, Inupiaq has at least 22 stems that are used to form demonstrative pronouns\nin eight different cases and demonstrative adverbs in four cases. American English\nhas two demonstrative pronouns [this and that] (plural forms these and those), with\ntheir respective adverbs here and there. (MacLean 2010, 49)\nIn a recent interview, Anishinaabe writer Gerald Vizenor asserted that language is\namong the most powerful forms of Indigenous resistance (Vizenor, Tuck, and Yang\n2014). Many generations of Indigenous intellectuals have insisted on the power of\nwords to make change and ensure self-determination and well-being (Deloria 1969;\nSmith 1999/2013), and along with Kawagley, MacLean, Rassmussen, and Ak-\nulukjuk, we see this power as derived from the rootedness of (Indigenous) lan-\nguages in land.\nAll of the articles in this special issue are written in English, despite the\nlimitations of the language that Indigenous authors have identified above (see also\nChambers 2008). Indeed, \u2018Native languages contain the map of the common pot\u2019 \u2013\nor the \u2018hollowed out places\u2019 formed by river intervales where Abenaki families\nlived in community \u2013 says Abenaki scholar Brooks (2008). \u2018(B)ut writing in\nEnglish is the means through which its boundaries have been maintained, asserted,\n4102\nhcraM\n90\n40:80\nta\n]322.342.71.17[\nyb\ndedaolnwoDEnvironmental Education Research 13\nand reclaimed\u2019 (254). This is to say that the work of making space for, and recog-\nnizing the sovereignty of Indigenous knowledges and languages can be accom-\nplished in English, even if nuanced and sophisticated renderings of land-based\nconcepts are made more possible within Indigenous languages. Bang et al. (this\nissue) argue that language work is necessary to confront the reification of settler\ncolonialism and Western intellectual traditions in place-based pedagogies (see also\nBowers 2003). These reifications, according to Bang et al., are akin to zero point\nepistemologies which erase and disavow all other perspectives; they perform an\nepistemic violence on Indigenous knowledges, eclipsing Indigenous points of refer-\nence. Thus, the authors argue that a focus on language is required in order to \u2018rup-\nture\u2019 the cognitive imperialism of the zero point of Eurocentric universalism and its\nrule over ontology and epistemology. Likewise, other authors in the special issue\npoint to the necessity of disrupting the \u2018rhetorical power of European universalism\u2019\n(Mignolo 2003 in Sato, Silva, and Jaber this issue, 104) or the \u2018cognitive imperial-\nism\u2019 (Battiste 2000) embedded in the language and assumptions of many forms of\n(environmental) education. The significance of naming and language is evident\nacross all nine of the articles in this special issue, and thus can be understood as an\nimportant feature of land education.\nWhy \u2018land education\u2019?\nLand education puts Indigenous epistemological and ontological accounts of land at\nthe center, including Indigenous understandings of land, Indigenous language in\nrelation to land, and Indigenous critiques of settler colonialism. It attends to con-\nstructions and storying of land and repatriation by Indigenous peoples, documenting\nand advancing Indigenous agency and land rights. We have highlighted these\naspects of land education as they are built through and across many of the articles\nin this special issue, and suggest that these characteristics advance environmental\neducation practice and research in important ways. In this section, we briefly out-\nline some of the linkages in prior writing on these themes within (environmental)\neducation, before turning to discuss in more depth how the characteristics of \u2018land\neducation,\u2019 as discussed so far and as elaborated throughout the issue, relate to\nthose of \u2018place-based education\u2019 as it has been evolving in the research literature to\ndate.\nLand education, as we have constructed it here, emphasizes educational research\nthat engages acute analyses of settler colonialism as a structure, a set of relations\nand conditions. Certainly, work has been undertaken on colonialism and land in\nenvironmental education fora by Indigenous scholars. For example, the work of\nO\u2019Riley and Cole (2009) has grappled with Indigenous and settler relationships to\nland and education in a Canadian context; Donald (2012) has theorized the central-\nity of the \u2018fort on frontier\u2019 as a signifier for the myth of civilization and modernity\nin the creation story of the Canadian nation-state; Le Grange (2009), Shava (2013),\nand others have written about colonialism and Indigenous knowledge in relation to\nenvironmental education research and practice in southern Africa.\nOther work by Indigenous and non-Indigenous scholars has taken up a focus on\ndecolonization in relation to environmental education, but typically not with a cri-\ntique of how colonialism in many contexts has involved settlement and displace-\nment as part of the land-based structure of colonialism in settler colonial contexts.\nFor example, Chambers (2008), learning from collaborations with several First\n4102\nhcraM\n90\n40:80\nta\n]322.342.71.17[\nyb\ndedaolnwoD14 Editorial\nNations communities in Northwest Territories in Canada, writes that there are four\ndimensions of a \u2018curriculum of place.\u2019 They include (as section headings):\n(1) A curriculum of place calls for a different sense of time.\n(2) A curriculum of place is enskillment.\n(3) A curriculum of place calls for an \u2018education of attention\u2019.\n(4) A curriculum of place is a wayfinding.\nTogether, these dimensions try to teach and learn how more than one people might\ncall a place home (215). A curriculum of place is configured to redress settlement\nand determine a shared (long) future. Chambers quotes Andy Blackwater, a Kainai\nelder, who said \u2018The Blackfoot are not going anywhere; the newcomers are not\ngoing anywhere; now the same peg anchors the tips of both\u2019 (in Chambers 2008,\n125). Chambers continues, \u2018It is not the grudge but the grief that matters, and what\nwe are going to do about it\u2019 (125).\nIn contrast to Chambers\u2019 aims of a curriculum of place, articles in a 2012 spe-\ncial issue of the Canadian Journal of Environmental Education on Decolonizing+\nIndigenizing: Moving Environmental Education Towards Reconciliation (edited by\nLisa Korteweg and Connie Russell) trouble notions of a shared future that is not\npreceded by a process of decolonization. Articles in the issue warn against tempta-\ntions to try to \u2018skip ahead\u2019 to \u2018some neutralized ahistorical, guilt-free, pain-free,\n\u201cromanticized\u201d version of environmental education\u2019 (Korteweg and Russell\n2012, 8). The articles in the special issue belie the seduction of claiming Indige-\nnous land as \u2018our\u2019 (settlers\u2019) \u2018special places\u2019 where feeling connected to the natural\nworld is possible; they also contravene claims that \u2018gifted/enlightened non-Indige-\nnous environmental or outdoor educators are the chosen ones to learn and pass on\nIndigenous knowledge and traditions\u2019 (Korteweg and Russell 2012, 8). Korteweg\nand Russell emphasize the importance of decolonization and \u2018Indigenizing\u2019 \u2013\n\u2018actively recognizing, centring, validating, and honouring Indigenous rights, values,\nepistemologies or worldviews, knowledge, language, and the stories of the people\nof the Land\u2019 (7) in environmental education toward reconstituting a shared future,\nor perhaps parallel futures, for settlers and Indigenous peoples.2\nThe aforementioned works withstanding, it is rare to find explicit discussions of\nsettler colonialism, decolonization, and Indigenous conceptualizations of land\nwithin environmental education research. Much of the work in environmental edu-\ncation research that is most conversant or related to what authors in this special\nissue are distinguishing as land education is described under the banner of \u2018place-\nbased education,\u2019so it makes sense to speak to how and why, at least for now, land\neducation is distinct from place-based education. Our hope, of course, is that place-\nbased education practitioners and researchers take more seriously and address more\nexplicitly the contexts of settler colonialism, the conditions and diversely articulated\naims of decolonization, and the epistemologically and ontologically distinct under-\nstandings of land lived by Indigenous peoples. Toward this end, we now attend to\nsome of the shared ground and departures between place-based education and land\neducation.\nOne of the core occupations of place-based education is facilitating meaningful\nrelationships to place. Indeed, because of human-caused carbon emissions and other\ndangers to climate and planetary stability, this work is necessary in part to cultivate\nthe humility needed to ensure the future of places (see Gruenewald and Smith\n4102\nhcraM\n90\n40:80\nta\n]322.342.71.17[\nyb\ndedaolnwoDEnvironmental Education Research 15\n2008, xix). Alan Gussow describes place as \u2018a piece of the whole environment\nwhich has been claimed by feelings\u2019 (quoted in Knapp 2008, 5). Gruenewald\nobserves,\nFor the most part, place-based educators use the term \u2018place\u2019 synonymously with\n\u2018community.\u2019 Indeed, both place-based and community-based educators advocate\nusing diverse communities as \u2018texts\u2019 for curriculum development and engaging\nteachers and learners in direct experience and inquiry projects that lead to democratic\nparticipation and social action within the local environment. (2008, 143)\nGruenewald continues by noting that an important distinction between place-based\neducation and community-based education is that place-based education is\nintentionally non-anthropocentric. Further, he clarifies, place-based education is\ncommitted to attending to what social and cultural theories overlook, including the\nland, natural environment, and non-human world (2008, 143).\nThe praxes of place-based education have forwarded important discussions that\nwould otherwise have been silenced, particularly the works of David Greenwood/\nGruenewald and others who have invoked descriptions of a critical pedagogy of\nplace to attend to the need for decolonization and anti-oppression. Yet, though\nearnest in attempts to acknowledge colonial histories of particular places, the\nplace-based and broader environmental education literature has replicated some of\nthe very problematic assumptions and imperatives of settler colonialism (see Bang\net al.; Calderon this issue). This collection draws readers\u2019 attention to these issues\nnot to point fingers, but to underscore the need for works in land education that\nexamine currents of settler colonialism as they course through environmental educa-\ntion and research. That is, the articles in this issue outline concerns about desires\ntoward settler emplacement that are often embedded in environmental education\nand research (see discussions in Bang et al.: Calderon; Engel-Di Mauro and\nCarroll; Paperson this issue).\n\u2018\u201cSettler\u201d is a way to describe colonizers that highlights their desires to be\nemplaced on Indigenous land\u2019 (Morgensen 2009, 157). Settler emplacement, in\nMorgensen\u2019s analysis, is the desire to resolve the experience of dis-location implicit\nin living on stolen land. A core strategy of emplacement is the discursive and literal\nreplacement of the Native by the settler, evident in laws and policies such as\neminent domain (and similar constructs), manifest destiny, property rights, and\nremovals, but also in boarding schools, sustained and broken treaties, adoptions,\nand resulting \u2018apologies\u2019 (See Coulthard 2007 for a discussion on the politics of\nreconciliation in Canada). \u2018Historically, a desire to live on Indigenous land and to\nfeel connected to it \u2013 bodily, emotionally, spiritually \u2013 has been the normative for-\nmation of settlers,\u2019 writes settler-scholar Morgensen (2009, 157; see also Korteweg\nand Oakley this issue).\nHere, we wish to differentiate the goal of settler emplacement, which is one\nway of resolving the colonial situation, from decolonization, which is another way.\nSettler emplacement, according to Morgensen (2009), can never lead to\ndecolonization.\nDecolonization does not follow if settlers simply study and emulate the lives of Indig-\nenous people on Indigenous land \u2026 [this] is relevant in particular to those for whom\nanarchism links them to communalism and counterculturalism, such as in rural\ncommunes, permaculture, squatting, hoboing, foraging, and neo-pagan, earth-based,\n4102\nhcraM\n90\n40:80\nta\n]322.342.71.17[\nyb\ndedaolnwoD16 Editorial\nand New Age spirituality. These \u2018alternative\u2019settler cultures formed by occupying and\ntraversing stolen Indigenous land and often by practicing cultural and spiritual appro-\npriation \u2026 They must ask, then, if their interest to support Indigenous people arose\nnot from an investment in decolonization, but in recolonization (157).\nSettler emplacement is incommensurable with decolonization, because at its basis is\na drive to replace the native as the rightful claimant of the land. Replacement relies\non fantasies of the extinct or becoming-extinct Indian as natural, forgone, inevita-\nble, indeed, and evolutionary (see Tuck and Gaztambide-Fern\u00e1ndez 2013). Replace-\nment is invested in settler futurity; in our use, futurity is more than the future, it is\nhow human narratives and perceptions of the past, future, and present inform cur-\nrent practices and framings in a way that (over)determines what registers as the\n(possible) future. Settler futurity, then, refers to what Andrew Baldwin calls the\n\u2018permanent virtuality\u2019 (2012, 173) of the settler on stolen land. Theorizing the sig-\nnificance of futurity for researching whiteness and geography, Baldwin (2012)\nexamines whether a history-centered analysis paves the way for the faulty,\nteleological assumption that [settler colonialism] can be modernized away. Such an\nassumption privileges an ontology of linear causality in which the past is thought to\nact on the present and the present is said to be an effect of whatever came before [\u2026]\nAccording to this kind of temporality, the future is the terrain upon or through which\n[settler colonialism] will get resolved. It cleaves the future from the present and, thus,\ngives the future discrete ontological form (174, insertion ours).\nReplacement and emplacement, to be clear, are entirely concerned with settler\nfuturity, which always indivisibly means the disruption of Indigenous life to aid set-\ntlement. Any form of justice or education that seeks to recuperate and not interrupt\nsettler colonialism, to reform the settlement and incorporate Indigenous peoples into\nthe multicultural settler colonial nation-state is invested in settler futurity.3\nThe resounding critique of place-based education offered by authors in this\nspecial issue is that \u2018it does not go far enough to connect how place \u2026 has been\ninexorably linked to the genocide of Indigenous peoples and continued settler\ncolonialism\u2019 (Calderon, 25; see also Bang et al.; Engel-Di Mauro and Carroll; and\nPaperson). \u2018While settler colonial violence and oppression is not an explicit aspect\nof place-based education,\u2019 Calderon continues, \u2018it nonetheless fails to meaningfully\naddress colonial legacies in education and particularly how conceptions of place\nhave been involved in their continuance\u2019 (25). In our view, the specific interven-\ntions that land education offers to place-based and environmental educators and\nresearchers are (1) the refusal of emplacement and replacement discourses in place-\nbased education and (2) the refusal of settler futurity as the referent of purpose or\njustice. We discuss each of these interventions in turn.\nThe refusal of emplacement and replacement discourses in place-based education\nGruenewald and Smith\u2019s influential edited volume, Place-Based Education in the\nGlobal Age (2008), locates a book by Wes Jackson, called Becoming Native to this\nPlace (1996), as providing questions that get at the core themes of place-based edu-\ncation (Gruenewald and Smith 2008, xix). These questions are indeed important,\nincluding \u2018What educational forms promote care for places?\u2019 and \u2018What does it\ntake to conserve, restore, and create ways of being that serve people and places?\u2019\n4102\nhcraM\n90\n40:80\nta\n]322.342.71.17[\nyb\ndedaolnwoDEnvironmental Education Research 17\nYet to answer them, Jackson, a settler, problematically advocates adopting a\n\u2018national goal\u2019 of \u2018becoming native to this place, this continent\u2019 (1996, 3). With no\nlexiconical self-consciousness, Jackson appropriates a generalized version of Indige-\nnous cultures, invoking the need to form an expanded tribe, the need to be native\nin a modern world. Mention of the \u2018first natives here\u2019 is entirely contained in the\npast \u2013 \u2018they\u2019 (the Indigenous peoples) were not burdened with the \u2018exercise of tech-\nnology assessment\u2019 (evaluating uses of fossil fuels and other industrial impacts on\nthe environment), as \u2018we\u2019 (the settlers) must be (3).\nGruenwald\u2019s later chapter in the same edited volume employs Jackson\u2019s focus\non \u2018becoming native\u2019 to aid his introduction to the concept of reinhabitation (Gru-\nenewald 2008; see also Greenwood 2013; Greenwood and McKenzie 2009; Swayze\n2009). In Gruenewald\u2019s words, \u2018Reinhabitation roughly equates with the deeper\nagenda of many environmental educators: to learn how to live well together in a\nplace without doing damage to others, human and nonhuman\u2019 (2008, 143). In\ndescribing her approach to reinhabitation within an environmental education pro-\ngram, Swayze (2009) says it has included these aims, \u2018embracing the local; using a\ncustomized, participatory approach (to inquiry); reconsidering the role of formal\ncurriculum; and, re-thinking what \u201csuccess\u201d is and how it is measured\u2019 (63).\nYet, because these definitions and approaches to reinhabitation do not recognize\nthe settler colonial histories of and Indigenous claims to the land that is intended to\nbe reinhabited, it is a concept that has been engaged and problematized by authors\nin this special issue (Bang et al.; Calderon; Paperson). Together, authors in this spe-\ncial issue ask, how can a place be inhabited or reinhabited if it has already long\nbeen inhabited by Indigenous peoples without this functioning as another form of\nsettler emplacement as colonization? (see also Morgensen 2009). It is precisely at\nthe juncture of concepts that have gained so much traction within place-based\neducation discourses, like reinhabitation, that the epistemological and ontological\ndifferences between place-based education and land education may be readily\nobserved, and where the need for a recognition and analysis of settler colonialism\nand settler emplacement and replacement are most evident.\nMore recent work on (re)inhabitation suggests it is necessarily coupled with\ndecolonization (Greenwood 2013; Greenwood and McKenzie 2009; Gruenewald\n2008; McKenzie 2008). But if theories of reinhabitation are reliant upon replace-\nment discourses like Jackson\u2019s, or other discourses that attempt to relieve settler\nanxiety and dis-location, reinhabitation may actually thwart decolonization.4\nThe refusal of settler futurity as the referent of purpose or justice\nA second intervention needs less explanation, but can have far greater impact on\nplace-based and environmental education and research; understanding and fostering\nsustainable relationships to land and the environment cannot happen when those\nactivities are accountable to a futurity in which settlers continue to dominate and\noccupy stolen Indigenous land. Maintaining settler futurity cannot be the purpose or\nside-effect of environmental education and research; this is not to say there is no\nfuture/ity for now-settlers, but that their relationships to Indigenous land and peoples\nmust be informed by an unsettled imaginary. Environmental justice can only take\nplace with Indigenous peoples and epistemologies at the center (see Calderon;\nMeyer; Sato, Silva and Jaber; Whitehouse et al. this issue). In addition, such theories\nof change cannot be expected to answer questions of what settlers\u2019 lives will look\n4102\nhcraM\n90\n40:80\nta\n]322.342.71.17[\nyb\ndedaolnwoD18 Editorial\nlike in/after the process of decolonization (Morgensen 2009; Paperson this issue;\nTuck and Yang 2012). Land education de-centers settlers and settler futurity as the\nprimary referents for possibility. Land education seeks decolonization, not settler\nemplacement. Land education is accountable to an Indigenous futurity.\nModes and methods of land education research\nA final key consideration of the special issue that we want to highlight is the meth-\nodologies and methods of research mobilized across the articles; as well as how the\narticles work across various registers and the further research considerations\nentailed in these crossings. We end by discussing modes and methodologies of\nresearch in relation to the authors of the articles, the article reviewers, editors at\nEnvironmental Education Research, and the articles\u2019 anticipated readers.\nAs indicated already, a range of methodologies and methods of research are\ndrawn upon in the articles included in the collection. These include historical\nanalysis (McCoy), critical cartography (Paperson), ethnography (Paperson), social\nmapping (Sato, Silva, and Jaber), community-based design research (Bang et al.),\ndocument analysis (Calderon; Whitehouse et al.), film analysis (Korteweg and\nOakley), photography (Meyer), and descriptive analyses of teaching practices\n(Engel-Di Mauro and Carroll). Though varied in shape and approach, we regard all\nof the contributions as research articles: some drawing on and sharing empirical\ndata collected through qualitative data collection methods (e.g. interviews and par-\nticipant observation in the articles of Bang et al.; Paperson; Sato, Silva and Jaber),\nothers are based on the empirical and conceptual analysis of textual or visual forms\n(e.g. the curriculum document analysis and film analysis of articles by Calderon;\nKorteweg and Oakley). Approaches of argumentation also vary across articles, from\nvisual approaches (Meyer), poetic approaches (Bang et al.), to partial stories\n(Paperson), and reconstructed histories (McCoy). Forms of research in environmen-\ntal education have expanded beyond those that are modeled on scientific methods\nand modes of representation (Hart 2005; McKenzie 2009), and with growing\nnumbers of scholarly works available on Indigenous research methodologies and\nconsiderations (e.g. Kovach 2010; Smith 1999/2013; Wilson 2008), there is a need\nfor a continued expansion of understandings in what counts as research in the\nreviewing, editing, and reading practices within environmental education.\nWe also want to draw attention to the ways in which the methodologies and\nmethods engaged in the issue gather and represent data on a variety of registers in\nconsidering land and land education. These include the temporal and spatial, as\nwell as material and other aspects of land. This is most clearly evident in the map-\nping articles by Sato, Silva, and Jaber, and by Paperson, in which relationships with\nland are mapped temporally (in relation to history/future) and spatially (in relation\nto geography) through visual and oral mapping exercises. Other articles, such as\nthose by Bang et al. and Whitehouse et al., similarly work across these multiple\nregisters in representing Chicago or Sea Country as storied land and as sites of land\neducation. These methodological dimensions of the articles ask us to consider not\nonly what land education is or might be, but how can we effectively research it? In\nwhat ways can we or should we try to understand learning in relationship to land?\nOn what registers can we or should we collect data? And what are the various\nethical considerations and protocols implied in these potential methods and modes\nof research? (Smith 1999/2013; Wilson 2008).\n4102\nhcraM\n90\n40:80\nta\n]322.342.71.17[\nyb\ndedaolnwoDEnvironmental Education Research 19\nAlso important for environmental education researchers to consider are the chal-\nlenges in expanding the field topically into new domains and priorities, such as\nthose of land education. Many of the authors represented in this issue could be con-\nsidered \u2018new\u2019 or early career scholars, in that they have completed doctorates\nwithin the last 10 years; and to some extent bring new experiences and topical con-\ncerns to educational research. In some cases, authors also are part of growing pro-\nportion of critical Indigenous educators and researchers contributing to rapidly\nexpanding bodies of scholarly work on Indigenous education and research within\nand beyond the field of environmental education. These are dynamics that both\nsupport the possibilities raised through this issue, but also are challenges in bridg-\ning fields, in getting past reviewers and/or in finding appropriate reviewers, in pub-\nlishing with impact. As Linda Tuhiwai Smith wrote 15years ago: \u2018While\nresearchers are trained to conform to the models provided for them, Indigenous\nresearchers have to meet these criteria as well as Indigenous criteria which can\njudge research as not \u201cuseful,\u201d \u201cnot Indigenous,\u201d \u201cnot friendly,\u201d \u201cnot just.\u201d Recon-\nciling such views can be difficult\u2019 (1999/2013, 140). As special issue editors, at\ntimes we questioned who we were writing and editing for, and the extent to which\nthe politics and language of this introduction and of the issue should be addressed\nto readers familiar and/or unfamiliar with the issues and priorities raised herein. We\nenvision and appreciate the possibilities and responsibilities of reading and writing\nenvironmental education research across paradigms, methods, and audiences (Reid\n2013).\nIn closing this introduction to the issue, we hope the collection inspires more\nplace-based and environmental education works that specifically engage settler\ncolonialism. Further, we hope the special issue draws attention to the need to\nanalyze the settler colonial histories of the places and ways in which we conduct\nenvironmental education research. Settler colonialism has not only violently\ninterrupted Indigenous life, but it has resulted in \u2018quick and brutal\u2019 environmental\ndegradation (Robinson and Tout 2012, 156, see also McCoy this issue).\nThe mass extinctions; resource scarcity; reliance on damaging coal, mining and\nlogging industries; public unpreparedness for seasonal drought, floods and bushfires;\nand rapid processes of urbanization, which together distinguish the contemporary\nAustralian situation [and the situation of most other settler colonial nation-states],\nindicate that settler Australians have not yet managed to become grounded on this\ncontinent and do not yet possess adequate or appropriate knowledges \u2013 in either form\nor degree \u2013 concerning the management and maintenance of Australian lands.\n(Robinson and Tout 2012, 156, insertion ours)\nWe issued the call for this special issue in 2011, before the remarkable Indige-\nnous movement Idle No More was founded in Canada; before it spread across\nNorth America and gained expressions of recognition and support from Indigenous\nand non-Indigenous peoples around the globe. Idle No More has already taught the\nworld about what we hope a land education does and will do: that is, to remind\npeople to place Indigenous understandings of land and life at the center of\nenvironmental issues and other (educational) issues; provide an explicit critique and\nrendering of settler colonialism, treaties, and sovereignty; invite and inspire acts of\nrefusal, reclamation, regeneration, and reimagination; and theorize pathways to\nliving as \u2018separate sovereignties on shared territory\u2019 (Simpson 2013).

Multicultural settler societies may consider Indigenous peoples to be just another ethnic\nor race group, which now successfully folded into the multicultural fabric, should\nexpect no pre-existing or special rights at all.\n2. To punctuate a prior point, one of the contributions of settler colonial studies is the\ninterruption of the binary of \u2018settler\u2019 and \u2018Indigenous,\u2019 by also theorizing the perspec-\ntives and structural locations of (descendants of) chattel slaves (Tuck and Yang 2012;\nWilderson 2010; Wolfe 2006), arrivants, and migrant workers (Byrd 2011; Patel 2012),\nand others living in settler colonial nation-states.\n3. In contrast, Indigenous futurity forecloses settler colonialism and settler epistemologies.\nThis does not mean that Indigenous futurity forecloses living on Indigenous land by\nnon-Indigenous peoples. That is to say that Indigenous futurity does not require the era-\nsure of now-settlers in the ways that settler futurity requires of Indigenous peoples (see\nalso Tuck and Gaztambide-Fern\u00e1ndez 2013).\n4. Tuck and Yang (2012) have cautioned against deploying the term \u2018decolonization\u2019 with-\nout specific attention to the repatriation of Indigenous land, recognition of Indigenous\nsovereignty, and abolition of slavery in all forms in the US nation-state. Decolonization\nis not a metaphor that can be applied to social justice projects that do not result in\nchanges in land distribution, use, and especially relationships. Following Fanon (1968),\nTuck and Yang emphasize that decolonization is always a historical process, specific to\nland and place.\nReferences\nAgrawal, Arun. 2002. \u201cIndigenous Knowledge and the Politics of Classification.\u201d Interna-\ntional Social Science Journal 54 (173): 287\u2013297.\nBaldwin, Andrew. 2012. \u201cWhiteness and Futurity: Towards a Research Agenda.\u201d Progress\nin Human Geography 36 (2): 172\u2013187.\nBattiste, Marie. 2000.

The current national education vision, the Alice Springs (Mparntwe)\nEducation Declaration (Education Council Secretariat, 2019) states that a purpose of education is to create \u201ca socially cohesive\nsociety that values respects and appreciates different points of view and cultural, social linguistic, and religious diversity\u201d\n(p. 5), framing key democratic principles as central to this work. Paradoxically, as the corporate-style education agenda con-\ntinues to narrow and limit an already Eurocentric, monocultural curriculum, and performance-manage teachers, democratic\napproaches such as critical thinking, problem-solving and experiential learning are at risk. In October 2023, the Australian peo-\nple were asked to vote on altering the Constitution to recognise the First Peoples of Australia by establishing an Aboriginal and\nTorres Strait Islander \u201cVoice\u201d to parliament. The Voice to Parliament would have provided greater representation in parliamen-\ntary processes and political decision making on matters impacting Indigenous peoples interests and rights (Fredericks, 2023,\np. 125). The divisive debate and vilification of Indigenous Australians that preceded the referendum and resulted in a resound-\ning \u201cNo\u201d vote, reflects the historical failure of the education system to prepare students for active and informed citizenship.\nLearning from Country (LFC), where knowledges shared by Aboriginal peoples and Country are positioned as central to\nunderstanding this country, suggests a way in which we might decolonise Australian education and address the social, cul-\ntural and environmental issues facing all citizens. This paper discusses Country-centred learning where teacher educators\nand preservice teachers learn from Country through walking with and listen to Aboriginal community-based educators to\ndevelop the pedagogical skills needed to implement a participatory democratic approach in their classrooms. LFC supports\nopportunities to story Aboriginal ways of being, knowing and doing into curriculum and pedagogy using a framework to\nguide teachers in ways that respect multiple local community perspectives to build cohesive school communities.\nKeywords Learning from Country \u00b7 Democratic education \u00b7 Australian Curriculum \u00b7 Aboriginal education\nIntroduction\ndemocratic principles as central to this work.

LFC is positioned as the critical first step in the CNS\nwhole-school reform project, which seeks to improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait\nIslander students\u2019 educational experiences and outcomes by developing teacher\ncapacity to deliver culturally responsive curriculum and pedagogies. By centring\nCountry and community, LFC, along with four other CNS strategies, encourages\nteachers to think, act and relate differently with respect to First Nations students,\nfamilies, communities and the places and histories in which they are grounded.\nDrawing on Burgess et al.\u2019s LFC framework, we found evidence of teachers: pro-\nfessing an ethical commitment to respecting and honouring local Aboriginal knowl-\nedges and knowledge holders; understanding the importance of connectedness and\nrelational practices in their teaching; reflecting critically on their pre-existing ideas\nabout Aboriginal students and communities and developing \u2018place-consciousness\u2019 or\n\u2018Country consciousness\u2019. We conclude that the LFC strategy is influencing the ways\nthat teachers conceptualise and enact education in relation to Country and commu-\nnity, with the potential to deliver significant benefits to First Nations students, fami-\nlies and communities.\nKeywords Learning from Country \u00b7 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander\neducation \u00b7 Aboriginal education \u00b7 First Nations Education \u00b7 Indigenous education \u00b7\nTeacher Education \u00b7 Culturally Nourishing Schooling \u00b7 Social justice \u00b7 Inclusive\neducation\nExtended author information available on the last page of the article\nVol.:(012134 536789)D. Coombs et al.\nIntroduction\nDominant approaches to education and schooling are failing First Nations1 students\nacross Australia. One reason for this is that \u2018mainstream\u2019 approaches do not nourish\nthe cultural identities of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students (Lowe et al.,\n2020), nor do they encourage teachers to engage meaningfully with Country or local\nAboriginal knowledges and cultures (Guenther et al., 2019). Learning from Country\n(LFC) is an attempt to disrupt the dominant and damaging practices of education in\nAustralia. LFC emerged from research (Burgess & Cavanagh, 2013) on the Connect-\ning to Country (CTC) program, a joint venture between the NSW Aboriginal Educa-\ntion Consultative Group (AECG) and the NSW Department of Education and Com-\nmunities (DEC). CTC consists of a three-day program provided by the local AECG\nand a two-day follow up program by the DEC, providing professional learning for\nlocal school staff. The success of CTC is noted by the researchers: \u2018the three-day\nAECG cultural immersion component had a dramatic, sometimes transformational\nimpact on the vast majority of participants. As a community-controlled program,\nthis is an original and innovative approach to teacher professional learning\u2019 (Burgess\n& Cavanagh, 2016, p. 50). Other studies have shown that positioning Country and\nAboriginal people at the centre of learning can be effective at improving Aborigi-\nnal education outcomes and experiences (Burgess, 2022; Lowe et al., 2020; Thorpe\net al., 2021).\nThis paper presents qualitative analysis and findings from data generated with\nteachers participating in a series of LFC activities in the Culturally Nourishing\nSchooling (CNS) project. CNS is a collaborative research project that establishes\na whole-school model supporting Aboriginal students\u2019 needs and aspirations. CNS\naims to examine dominant education practices and policies from a critical Indig-\nenous standpoint; establish new arrangements and agreements between schools and\nlocal Aboriginal communities; and develop critically informed curricula and peda-\ngogies that improve Aboriginal students\u2019 educational outcomes and experiences\n(Lowe et al., 2020). The project is grounded in evidence-based insights from the\nAboriginal Voices Systematic Reviews of 15,000 + Indigenous education research\narticles in Australia (see Moodie et al., 2021). The CNS model has five direct pro-\nfessional learning strategies; a reference Group and \u2018Blak Caucus\u20192 consisting of\nAboriginal community members. The professional learning strategies emphasise the\ninclusion of cultural knowledges and practices such as (1) LFC, which foregrounds\nthe importance of understanding learning in a place; (2) Professional Learning Con-\nversations\u2014discuss concepts related to pedagogy and curriculum choices; (3) Cul-\ntural Mentoring\u2014supports relationship-building with the local Community, provid-\ning learning partners for teachers and lastly; (4) Curriculum Workshops\u2014scaffolded\n1 When the terms Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander or First Nations or \u2018Indigenous\u2019 are used (inter-\nchangeably) in this article, it refers to the First Peoples of Australia. We acknowledge that these terms\narose within colonial circumstances and are used variously in communities.\n2 The Blak Caucus refers to the group of Aboriginal educators and community members from across all\nthe participating schools that regularly meets to discuss concerns to do with the project.\n1 3The impact of Learning from Country on teachers\u2019 understandings\u2026\ncollaborative curriculum planning; and (5) Culturally Nourishing Pedagogies\u2014\nfacilitated pedagogical coaching (Lowe et al., 2020). These strategies are intercon-\nnected and work together in the CNS project. They are designed to help schools\nbuild collective capacity to mitigate historically derived imbalances of power and\nprivilege. Additionally, they attempt to address the failure of the Australian school\nsystem to meet the cultural, social and educational needs of Aboriginal and Torres\nStrait Islander students.\nThe CNS project helps school leaders and teachers to create and implement sus-\ntainable reforms that place Country, culture and community at the heart of school-\ning. It currently operates at eight NSW Government-operated, all-gender schools on\nGadigal, Dharawal, Wiradjuri, Kamilaroi, Wailwan, Ngiyampaa, Barkindji, Tul-gi-\ngin and Moorange-Moobar Countries in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Each\nyear a cohort of 6\u201310 personnel from each school participates in the five profes-\nsional learning strategies and a new group of teachers joins the CNS project each\nyear. The focus is on increasing collective understanding of how best to support\nwhole-school reform and to develop teaching and leadership capacity that centres\nstrong relationships with Aboriginal students, families and communities.\nThe interest of this paper is in the first strategy, LFC, which is about deepening\nunderstanding of \u2018Country\u2019 and the local contexts of each community\u2019s schooling\nexperiences, its histories and lived experiences, important socio-historical events\nand cultural knowledge. This deep engagement with local Aboriginal knowledges,\ncultures and histories involves the local Aboriginal Education Consultative Groups\n(AECGs) and or other Aboriginal organisations. LFC is co-led by each school\u2019s\nAboriginal Education Officer (AEO), Cultural Mentors and local Aboriginal Elders\nand community members.\nWe argue that LFC is the critical first step for teachers in orientating themselves\nto work in a culturally responsive way with First Nations students, their families and\ntheir communities. LFC is changing the ways that teachers engage with Country,\nlocal Aboriginal Communities and relevant Aboriginal Knowledge holders. Criti-\ncally, LFC prioritises respectful relationships and relationality as the primary ethic\nand mode of engagement with Aboriginal students, families and communities (see\nBishop et al., 2019).\nA statement on our positionality\nWe take on the call by Blair (2016) to position ourselves, regardless of whether we\nare the reader, the author, or the thinker. How we position our voice and ourselves\n\u2018in the contested space, the space in between Indigenous and non-Indigenous intel-\nlectual traditions\u2019, (Blair, 2016, p. 156) is essential to recognising that \u2018where we\nstand in relation to others in society shapes what we can see and understand about\nthe world\u2019 (Sensoy & DiAngelo, 2017, p. 30). We acknowledge that our socio-\nhistorical and political location influences our orientation; thus, we are part of the\nsocial processes/fabric in which the work we present in this paper sits. The follow-\ning few words are partial accounts of our stories and connections. We\u2014Aboriginal\nand non-Aboriginal authors, researchers and practitioners\u2014are committed to finding\n1 3D.

Moreover, the positioning of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait\nIslander Cross Curriculum Priority in the Australian Curriculum (ACARA, 2011)\nas optional, allowing teachers to include Aboriginal content where they see fit,\nmakes for an ad hoc and incoherent curriculum narrative that is difficult to weave\nthrough multiple subject areas (Salter & Maxwell, 2016). This educational avoid-\nance continues, despite the intent of the Alice Springs (Mparntwe) Declaration\nof Educational Goals for Young Australians (Education Council, 2019) to create,\n\u2018active and informed members of the community who\u2026 understand, acknowledge\n1 3The impact of Learning from Country on teachers\u2019 understandings\u2026\nand celebrate the diversity and richness of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander\nhistories and cultures\u2019 (p. 8). The disconnect between policy and practice further\nalienates teachers from engaging with Aboriginal histories and cultures in mean-\ningful and respectful ways.\nA LFC approach attempts to resolve the dissonance teachers feel when trying\nto do this work. It is a localised place-based approach that connects teachers to\ntheir local area through Aboriginal relationships to Country and to local families\nand communities. LFC creates a sense of belonging and inclusivity, and positions\nAboriginal people as knowledge holders and custodians of their lands. Country is\nan Aboriginal English (as different from Standard Australian English) term that\ngoes beyond geographic location and describes land as a living entity, the essence\nof Aboriginality and includes relational connection to people, culture, spiritual-\nity, history, environment and ecologies of the non-human world (Burgess, et al.,\n2022a). Aunty Laklak Burarrwanga, a Datiwuy Elder, Caretaker for Gumatj helps\nus to recognise the depth and qualities of Country, the significance of the rela-\ntionship that people have with Country and that Country is alive:\nCountry can be talked to, it can be known, it can itself communicate, feel\nand take action. Country for us is alive with story, law, power and kinship\nrelations that join not only people to each other but link people, ancestors,\nplace, animals, rocks, plants, stories and songs within land and sea. So,\nyou see knowledge about Country is important because it\u2019s about how and\nwhere you fit within the world and how you connect to others and to place.\n(Burarrwanga et al., 2013, p. 54)\nFurther explanation from Aboriginal academic Bronwyn Fredericks (2013)\nsuggests that the term Country refers to specific Aboriginal nations, including the\n\u2018knowledge, cultural norms, values, stories and resources within that particular\narea\u2014that particular Indigenous place\u2019 (p. 6). Porter (2018) makes the significant\npoint that Country is everywhere \u2026\n[e]very inch of glass, steel, concrete and tarmac is dug into and bolted onto\nCountry\u2026 because most of us live in towns and cities \u2013 we appear unable\nand unwilling to grasp that this urban country is also urban Country. (p.\n239)\nMoreover, even in highly urbanised places, people with Aboriginal cultural\nknowledge can \u2018tune in\u2019 to Country and access valuable information:\nI\u2019m always learning even when I\u2019m not by just looking at the environment\nbecause that\u2019s my big TV that\u2019s switched on even if I hadn\u2019t tuned in \u2026 I\nsay, this is my TV, my big billboard. You walk past down there, and it says,\nthis is playing tonight. I just look at the trees and they\u2019re telling me what\u2019s\nhappening. Everything\u2019s telling me what\u2019s happening. (Aboriginal commu-\nnity-based educator in Sydney, quoted in Thorpe et al., in press)\nThis sensibility towards Country resonates with notions of place-based pedago-\ngies and land education, which are applied more globally to describe Aboriginal\n1 3D. Coombs et al.\nconnections to place that include cultural, historical and socio-political connec-\ntions beyond geographical and ecological features. In settler colonial societies\nsuch as Australia, understandings of land are built on First Nations peoples\u2019 dis-\npossession from their Country, which allows settlers to benefit economically and\npolitically from repossession of these lands. Ruitenberg\u2019s (2005) articulation of a\n\u2018place consciousness\u2019 resonates with this study:\nEach place has a history, often a contested history, of the people who inhabited\nit in past times. Each place has an aesthetics, offers a sensory environment of\nsound, movement and image that is open to multiple interpretations. And each\n(inhabited) place has a spatial configuration through which power and other\nsocio-politico-cultural mechanisms are at play. (p. 215)\nAdditionally, Gruenwald\u2019s (2003) critical pedagogy of place gives us another\nentry point to expand on our conceptualisation of LFC. He presents an opportu-\nnity for us to deepen our understanding of Aboriginal connections to Country by\ndecentring and destabilising Western understandings of land and place. A critical\npedagogy of place is enacted through a LFC approach as teachers walk with Abo-\nriginal peoples on Country and listen to lived experiences of colonisation, exclu-\nsion and intergenerational trauma. This pedagogical approach has the capacity to\nprompt a critical consciousness in teachers that requires humility, integrity and hon-\nesty and encourages reciprocity that gives back to and nourishes Country. Freire\n(1974) argues that developing a critical consciousness is transformative in provok-\ning social change and is required to shift thinking from Western dominated con-\ncepts to Aboriginal ways of knowing, being and doing (Burgess, 2022). Through\nthese processes, teachers begin to conceptualise what decolonising the curriculum\nand indeed, schooling itself, might look like as they develop their cultural capabil-\nity and confidence in embarking on this journey to make a difference for Aboriginal\nstudents, their families and their communities. This place-based critical conscious-\nness, drawing on Aboriginal understandings of place, can be understood as \u2018Country\nconsciousness\u2019 (see also Thorpe et al., 2021, p. 59).\nMethodological approach\nThe LFC strategy and the CNS project are more broadly guided by criti-\ncal Indigenous methodologies (Guenther et al., 2019; Lowe et al., 2020). This\napproach to research and action privileges and prioritises localised Indigenous\nknowledges, histories and experiences. The CNS project centres relational-\nity\u2014between teachers and students, between CNS schools and local Aboriginal\ncommunities and between people (including teachers and students) and Country.\nThe LFC strategy is primarily concerned with the relationality between people\nand Country and how teachers can embed it into their practice to make school-\ning more meaningful for students\u2014Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal alike. Those\ninvolved in the CNS project are committed to achieving substantive change to\nthe practices, understandings and conditions that structure schooling in Aus-\ntralia, towards the ultimate goal of improving Aboriginal students\u2019 experiences\n1 3The impact of Learning from Country on teachers\u2019 understandings\u2026\nof education (Lowe et al., 2020, p. 470). The research project has been approved\nby the UNSW Human Research Ethics Committee (approval no. HC200310).\nAll participating CNS schools have engaged in LFC, regardless of whether\nthey are in urban, regional or remote locations. Eight schools were involved\nin the LFC strategy and teachers from across the full range of Key Learning\nAreas (KLA) participated. LFC participants included classroom teachers, execu-\ntive and administrative staff and community members. For this paper, our focus\nis on teachers (N = 44) and our dataset is reflective of that. For context, when\npresenting the data we include the location of each teacher, but in our findings\nand analysis we have not identified any significance of location. One group of\nteachers participates in LFC activities per year. Two schools did not join CNS\nuntil 2022, the second year of the project. In total, 14 groups of teachers par-\nticipated in LFC activities across the first 2 years of CNS\u2019 operation. Because of\nthe unique context of each school, the decision about who would be involved in\nthe project was made locally. The LFC experiences are driven by the local Abo-\nriginal communities in consultation with school leaders and CNS teachers. The\ncommunities invested significant time organising the LFC activities according to\nthe learnings they wanted the teachers to experience. Generally, LFC activities\nwere spread across two days and involved: excursions to places of significance\nto the local Aboriginal community; visits to Aboriginal community-controlled\norganisations; and other immersive interactions with the natural and built envi-\nronments surrounding the schools and the communities at large. Most of the\ninteractions occurred informally during lunches, side conversations and travel-\nling to the sites. Local Aboriginal communities and Elders were reimbursed for\ntheir time and locally based Aboriginal Cultural Mentors were employed in each\nlocation to support teachers in this work. Reimbursement was done in accord-\nance with their employment contract. LFC is intended as the first CNS activity\nthat teachers engage in; it is designed as the critical orientating and grounding\nexperience that exposes teachers to the role of Country in holding knowledge,\nteaching and learning and relating.\nThe data used for this article was collected in 2021 and 2022. A range of\ndata collection methods was used. In 2021, teachers submitted written responses\n(n = 13) to a set of reflective questions about LFC. In 2022, in addition to the\nreflections, participants were invited to submit photo-stories (n = 14) about their\nLFC experiences. This method encouraged teachers to create more specific links\nbetween their written reflections and the places visited during the excursions.\nIt also helped them to \u2018story\u2019 the local community and the places in which it is\nembedded. In some CNS schools, semi-structured focus groups (n = 10) were\nconducted instead of or in addition to written reflections or photo-stories. One-\non-one semi-structured interviews (n = 8) with urban-based CNS teachers, col-\nlected by a doctoral research student on the project, were also included in this\ndata set. The written responses, photo-stories and focus groups were conducted\nat the conclusion of the LFC experiences. The interviews were conducted within\n3 months of the LFC experiences.\n1 3D. Coombs et al.\nFigure 1 Learning from Country framework.\nData analysis\nThe LFC framework by Burgess et al. (2022b) guided our analysis of our data set\nas the themes and sub-themes aligned with the four processes of the Framework.\nThe LFC Framework was instrumental in how we coded together various emerg-\ning themes. The LFC Framework diagram (Fig. 1) depicts a metaphor of water, as\nwaterways are a life source that crisscross the Country in which our LFC experi-\nences occur. This framework was inspired by Yunkaporta and Shillingsworth\u2019s\n(2020) relationally responsive standpoint, which outlines the learning and teach-\ning process as Respect, Connect, Reflect and Direct.\nThe principles of thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2012) were used to\nanalyse the data set. This analysis was structured around a coding tree or schema.\nAll coding and thematic grouping were undertaken using the NVivo 12 qualita-\ntive analysis software. Most themes were constructed deductively, based on the\nresearchers\u2019 pre-existing understandings of important concepts, relationships,\npractices and principles related to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education.\nA minority of themes were constructed inductively, through iterative engagement\nwith the data set and reflection on the available literature (e.g. Burgess et al.,\n1 3The impact of Learning from Country on teachers\u2019 understandings\u2026\n2022b; Thorpe et al., 2021) and discussion amongst the research team. For brev-\nity and focus, in this article we concentrate on the findings that relate to the first\ntwo processes of the Framework: Country-centred relationships; and relating. In\nsubsequent papers, we will report the findings that relate to the third and fourth\nprocesses of the LFC Framework: critical engagement and mobilising.\nA framework for learning from country\nThe LFC Framework (Burgess et al., 2022b) used to discuss the findings in this\npaper emerges from a teaching/research project designed to position Country and\nAboriginal voices at the centre of learning for preservice teachers (see also Thorpe\net al., 2021). Here, local Aboriginal community members led preservice teachers\nthrough narratives of resilience, resistance and reciprocity with Country as guide\nand teacher. These experiences reorientated preservice teachers\u2019 thinking and prac-\ntice from a Western information-based approach to curriculum and pedagogy to\none that foregrounds relationship-based curriculum and pedagogy located on Coun-\ntry where place and relationality are central. This reorientation is reflected in the\norganic emergence of the framework generated through the on Country experiences\nof preservice teachers, Aboriginal community-based educators and academics, as\nwell as its application in analysing responses to Country. This process continued\ninto the preservice teachers\u2019 first few years of teaching, highlighting the non-linear,\nreflexive and relational process that links the past, present and future in a lifelong\nlearning journey. The success of LFC with pre-service and early-career teachers was\nthe reason that it was included in the CNS project.\nThe above LFC Framework diagram (Burgess et al., 2022b, p. 931) depicts a met-\naphor of water, as waterways are a life source that crisscross the Country in which\nour LFC experiences occur.\nThe dark blue acknowledges that Country is strong\u2014 it is \u2018full\u2019 of knowledge.\nThe light blue circles represent the \u2018activity\u2019 emanating and rippling through-\nout the Learning from Country processes which include deep listening to Abo-\nriginal community voices and truth telling. There is a rippling of knowledge\nand relational connections that flow from one waterhole to the next. As each\nwaterhole ripples with new knowledge and impacts on existing knowledge, it\nflows into the next waterhole. The connecting waterways between the water-\nholes represent the ebb and flow of knowledges and understandings that ripple\nthrough each waterhole... (Burgess et al., 2022b)\nAs the teachers found, these bodies of water can be calm, choppy, even rough,\nbut by continuing to build relationships and understand the relational connections in\ntheir \u2018new\u2019 Country, this helps them to move along the ebb and flow that is quintes-\nsentially teaching.\nAs noted above, this framework was inspired by Yunkaporta and Shillingsworth\u2019s\n(2020) metaphors for process outlined in their relationally responsive standpoint.\nThey describe this as follows:\n1 3D. Coombs et al.\n1. The first step of Respect is aligned with values and protocols of introduction,\nsetting rules and boundaries. This is the work of your spirit, your gut.\n2. The second step, Connect, is about establishing strong relationships and routines\nof exchange that are equal for all involved. Your way of being is your way of\nrelating, because all things only exist in relationship to other things. This is the\nwork of your heart.\n3. The third step, Reflect, is about thinking as part of the group and collectively\nestablishing a shared body of knowledge to inform what you will do. This is the\nwork of the head.\n4. The final step, Direct, is about acting on that shared knowledge in ways that are\nnegotiated by all. This is the work of the hands. (p. 11-12)\nThis approach was evident in the way teachers inverted their thinking and practice to\nprioritise values, protocols and relationship-building with Aboriginal people to dem-\nonstrate respect and begin to connect with Country and the knowledges that emerge.\nThis reordering is represented in the first waterhole of the framework, \u2018Country-cen-\ntred relationships\u2019, which flows onto the next waterhole, \u2018Relating\u2019.\nThrough deep listening and affective engagement with truth telling, teachers felt\na sense of belonging to Aboriginal narratives of Country, including the often-trau-\nmatic knowledges that emerge from colonisation. As the Aboriginal community-\nbased educators generously invited the teachers to better understand Australia\u2019s\ncomplex history from an Aboriginal standpoint (Yunkaporta & Shillingsworth,\n2020), teachers developed their critical engagement (third process) with this \u2018new\u2019\nknowledge, reflecting on their positionality and relationship to these narratives, as\nwell as to their role and responsibility as teacher.\nUpon understanding the deep relational connections between Country, Aborigi-\nnal people and knowledges, teachers felt more confident in sharing knowledges and\nmobilising these through culturally nourishing teaching practices (fourth process).\nEnacting Country in this way acknowledges sovereignty, reciprocity and Aboriginal\nknowledges in respectful ways that continue to strengthen critical relationships and\nbuild confidence to decolonise educational structures and processes that marginalise\nAboriginal students and their families.\nFindings and analysis\nDeveloping Country Centred Relationships\nA primary objective of the CNS project is to develop a sustainable model of\nschooling that produces \u2018educational experiences that improve the academic\nachievements of Indigenous students, while also further strengthening their iden-\ntities and connections to place\u2019 (Lowe et al., 2020, p. 468). LFC is a core strategy\nof the project that supports the development of productive and sustained educa-\ntive partnerships between schools and Aboriginal communities. Responses from\nteachers after the LFC experiences demonstrate the strategy\u2019s impact on their\n1 3The impact of Learning from Country on teachers\u2019 understandings\u2026\nunderstandings of Country and community. Teacher responses show a deepen-\ning ethical commitment to respecting and honouring local Aboriginal knowledges\nand knowledge holders.\nCountry as inspiration\nSeveral teachers described LFC as an inspiration and a starting point for ongoing\nprofessional development and personal growth, indicating their increasing respect\nfor Country and community. Moreover, we found some evidence of teachers posi-\ntioning \u2018Country as teacher\u2019 (McKnight, 2016, p. 12). Some of their reflections\ncan be interpreted as evidence of a growing capacity for reflexivity, deep listening\nand cultural humility, as they sought to make sense of their responses to LFC.\nExamples included making moves away from seeing humans as the only knowl-\nedge holders and making some emergent \u2018relational connections to Country\u2019\n(Burgess et al., 2022a, 2022b, p. 163). This change gives us hope that the LFC\nexperiences can assist teachers to value knowledge systems other than dominant\nWestern notions (see also Thorpe et al., 2021, p. 60).\nIntegral to experiencing Country was developing a growing understanding of\ncommunity, as teachers participated in the ethical processes of respecting local\nAboriginal community peoples and their narratives of place (Thorpe et al., 2021).\nTeachers started to appreciate the importance of connections between families,\norganisations and local social and cultural activities and the impact of colonisa-\ntion on these. Through LFC, teachers deepened their understanding of and respect\nfor community and Country. For example, a teacher in a remote school described\nCountry as a powerful unifying force for all peoples living in Australia:\nIt\u2019s one of the things that was most exciting about the project \u2013 it was cen-\ntred on Country \u2026that\u2019s what brings everyone who lives on this Country\ntogether. Whatever cultural background you have, there is a sense that this\nis special sacred land. And by living here you\u2019re changed. \u2026 We\u2019re all in\nCountry, we\u2019re all on Country. And that to me felt like a real bridge as well.\n(Focus group participant)\nAnother teacher, this time from an urban location, demonstrated an appreci-\nation of the central importance and omnipresence of Country and expressed a\ndesire to share this knowledge with others: \u2018I think, you know, showing every-\nbody how important Country is and where it is. It\u2019s everywhere\u2019 (Mel). Making\na related point, a teacher from another school emphasised the diversity of under-\nstandings of Country within and between Aboriginal communities:\nThe only thing that remains the same in these perspectives of the same\nCountry, is the consistency of the formation of the land, sun, water etc. This\nignites my understanding of Country, that just because the land is perceived\none way to one individual or group, it does not mean it is viewed the same\nby another individual or group, specifically, culturally. (Bianca)\n1 3D. Coombs et al.\nAlso emphasising the centrality of Country, Umar, a teacher at a regional\nschool, explained it as the starting point for further investigation of local Aborigi-\nnal peoples, histories and cultures:\nThe biggest thing for me is that it\u2019s the spark that starts it. So, it\u2019s the spark,\nthe inspiration that and the inspiration to maybe learn more, or to find out\nmore to make those connections \u2026 Yeah, so just like an inspiration\u2026 I\nthink by itself, it\u2019s probably not enough but it\u2019s enough to start you looking\nfurther. (Umar)\nWe argue that these teachers\u2019 growing appreciation of the fundamental impor-\ntance of Country in learning and teaching increases their sense of belonging and\nembeddedness in place and community. These realisations can be viewed as exam-\nples of teachers developing their personal \u2018critical pedagogies of place\u2019, which\nThorpe and colleagues describe as \u2018a deep understanding of the importance of\nplace and the inherent significance of \u201cCountry\u201d in an Indigenous framing of place\u2019\n(2021, p. 59). As one of the teachers, Uday, notes: \u2018The connection to Country and\nthe sense of belonging is quite pivotal\u2019.\nCountry as Teacher\nBy positioning Country as teacher (McKnight, 2016) many teachers are foreground-\ning accountability, reciprocity and obligation to Country and community. Several\nteachers stated that they learn something new every time they are on Country and\nare starting to see Country as a teacher, ascribing it with agency and a life force\nin line with Aboriginal worldviews. Bird Rose (1996) notes that \u2018Aboriginal people\ntalk about country in the same way that they would talk about a person\u2019 (1996, p. 7).\nThis notion was reflected in the way some teachers personified Country and viewed\nit as a source of knowledge. For example, Uday stated: \u2018Every time I\u2019m on Coun-\ntry I learn something new. I consolidate previous learning and look forward to the\nnext chance to learn\u2019. Moreover, Umar described a significant shift in his worldview,\nrelated to his LFC experiences:\nThat was the first time I\u2019d seen the world, Country, through an Aboriginal\u2019s\neye. When it - the way he explains how the, the landscape talks to him and\ntalks to each other, he sort of personifies everything, the plants, the animals.\nThat changed my worldview\u2026When I go bushwalking now, I look at the rocks\nand the plants in a different way, which is cool\u2026 I just think I just get it. I\nthink I just get it better. And I didn\u2019t get it before. Didn\u2019t understand it. I try my\nhardest to explain it to other people, but it\u2019s quite tricky to do.\nFran, a teacher in a regional high school, also afforded agency to Country:\nCountry speaks to me through these landmarks because they hold the history,\nstories and knowledge of the people and of Country and through gaining more\nknowledge about these landmarks I have personally garnered more apprecia-\ntion for the long history of people living on the land.\n1 3The impact of Learning from Country on teachers\u2019 understandings\u2026\nTeachers\u2019 experiences of LFC suggest that through \u2018deep listening\u2019 they gain an\nunderstanding of what Burgess et al. (2022b) describe as \u2018Country Centred Rela-\ntionships\u2019 and Yunkaporta and Shillingsworth\u2019s (2020) ethical process of \u2018respect\u2019.\nSuch relating involves \u2018decentring humans as the sole knowledge holders and devel-\noping relational connections to Country through deep listening and reflection\u2019 (Bur-\ngess et al., 2022b, p. 933). Several CNS teachers alluded to this, as Bianca explains\nhere:\nI really saw Country from a whole new perspective, two new ideas that I would\nlike to build on would be perspective and respect. Perspective of how each cul-\nture and individual sees the same thing differently and in turn, the notion to\nrespect[ing] this perception.\nBianca\u2019s reflection, and similar statements from other teachers, indicates that\nLFC enables a greater appreciation of the diversity within and between Aboriginal\ncommunities and cultures. CNS teachers described a range of specific teachings\nfrom Country that are linked to different communities. We argue that this reflects\ntheir developing a more nuanced and localised understanding of place, community\nand knowledge.\nAppreciating diversity and localising knowledge\nAs teachers open themselves up to understanding and respecting Aboriginal perspec-\ntives and knowledges, this gives them a greater sense of connection and belonging\nto their local communities (Thorpe et al., 2021). This openness can lead to changes\nin teachers\u2019 worldviews and relationships to Country; it is a beginning point for fur-\nther exploration and learning. For example, Diane, who teaches in one of the urban-\nbased CNS schools, was able to acknowledge the local community as a dynamic and\ncomplex place:\nThe [LFC] day helped me develop more understanding of the local community\nin which I work and a greater appreciation of the community as a cultural and\npolitical centre and meeting place. It certainly helped me appreciate the dyna-\nmism and complexity of Aboriginal politics more broadly. (Diane)\nBarbara, a teacher from an urban-based school, emphasised the ongoing strength\nwithin community:\nHer presentation showed the resilience of the people in the community and I\nwas particularly interested in the initiative taken by younger members of the\ncommunity and the investment in their roles as leaders and future caretakers of\nthe many organisations running.\nLFC also assisted teachers with making connections to local Aboriginal organ-\nisations and Elders. Some teachers gained the confidence and ability to refer and\nlink students to local Aboriginal organisations, e.g.: \u2018It allowed me to connect more\nwith the community and what services are available for them [Aboriginal students]\u2019\n1 3D. Coombs et al.\n(Gabriel). This same teacher also affirmed the value of connecting with local ser-\nvices through LFC:\nIt provides this strong element of context and connection to the community.\nAlso places where you can get assistance or refer students to or get them\ninvolved with, but even just sort of, you know, knowing more people in the\ncommunity and getting stronger with that. Building those ties. (Gabriel)\nOther teachers gained an appreciation of the culturally safe environment that\nAboriginal community-controlled organisations strive to create for their clients,\nincluding Aboriginal young people. These understandings are critical for teachers\nso they can build relationships with Aboriginal students, their families and the com-\nmunity and include local knowledges in teaching and in classrooms.\nUnderstanding culture\nSeveral teachers reflected on their growing appreciation of Aboriginal culture, which\nincludes understandings of language, identity, worldview, values and standpoints.\nFor example, reflecting on the impact of LFC, Gabriel offered the following:\nIt helps some way toward understanding where they might be coming from, to\nunderstand what they, their family, their community has gone through and how\nthey might relate to anyone outside that world as a result.\nMaking a related point, Laura, a teacher in a remote school, highlighted the holis-\ntic nature of Aboriginal approaches to education and development, emphasising the\nnon-academic elements:\nEducation is both cultural and academic and that we need to place more focus\non the cultural/spiritual aspects of education\u2026 culture plays an important part\nin Indigenous education.\nSimilarly, another teacher from a remote school, Nicole, highlighted the impor-\ntance of engaging with the local community\u2019s important cultural celebrations and\nevents: \u2018Gaining an understanding of the cultural traditions and celebrating with\nAboriginal people is imperative\u2019. Moreover, Estelle, a music teacher in a regional\nschool, reflected on the importance of an ethic of care and respect that she had\nobserved in her local Aboriginal community:\nI just liked their culture, how they really respect their Elders\u2026 They\u2019re gener-\nous with each other and look out for each other. They\u2019ve got a strong sense of\nfamily. And it\u2019s not just your own little immediate clan, it\u2019s all of them. But\ntheir community, their sense of togetherness and the way they belong together.\nThis data indicates that some teachers are beginning to understand the signifi-\ncance of community, culture and Country in creating a sense of belonging for Abo-\nriginal students. In future research we will examine how teachers are translating this\nknowledge in their classroom practice.\n1 3The impact of Learning from Country on teachers\u2019 understandings\u2026\nKnowing your Students through LFC\n\u2018Knowing your students\u2019 is a key dimension of the Australian Professional Stand-\nards for Teachers (2017) and was seen by many teachers as a key imperative from\nthe CNS LFC strategy. Through these experiences, teachers were able to better\nunderstand the individual circumstances of students in their schools and commu-\nnities. This learning was reported by teachers working across urban, regional and\nremote locations. As Nelly notes:\nIt is really important as a teacher to know about your students\u2019 communities\nand the places of significance\u2026 Visiting this space provides me with knowl-\nedge about who my students are and their communities.\nFurther, Barbara remarked: \u2018The Learning from Country PL has further high-\nlighted the importance of community and kinship structures for Aboriginal stu-\ndents\u2019. She also noted the utility of applying a LFC approach for their students learn-\ning. Barbara continued:\nMy students in this subject learn best when they are able to engage with com-\nmunity members and experts on the topics taught in the course \u2026 (they) \u2026\nlearn best when they are able to see first-hand what they are learning about.\nOverall, teachers\u2019 reflections on their LFC experiences revealed a growing appre-\nciation of the value of community connections, an enhanced understanding of local\nAboriginal cultures and experiences and a deeper understanding of who their Abo-\nriginal students are and how they learn. In many of the teachers\u2019 reflections there\nwas a notable emphasis on the importance of building stronger relationships with\nAboriginal students and other important people in the community. Therefore, start-\ning with Country-centred relationships in the LFC Framework (Burgess, et al.,\n2022b), prepares teachers for a greater understanding and appreciation for the\nimportance of relationality and connectedness in Aboriginal world views.\nRelating\nYunkaporta and Shillingsworth (2020) write that \u2018A relationally responsive stand-\npoint demands that you work with local knowledge to produce cultural processes,\nnot just cultural content\u2019 (p. 3). The ontologies of connectedness within Aboriginal\ncultural life are mirrored by the centrality of relationships in culturally nourishing\nschooling. The teachers\u2019 relationship-building with Elders, parents and community\nmembers during their LFC experiences exemplify Yunkaporta and Shillingsworth\u2019s\n(2020) processes of respecting and connecting. LFC reminded teachers that rela-\ntionships are, in fact, foundational to their work. These experiences of connection\nappeared to open conduits of relationality from community members, via the teach-\ners, to their students, as teachers began to understand the importance of connected-\nness and relational practices in the classroom.\nOpportunities to connect in a relaxed environment, away from the school, offered\nteachers and community members opportunities for emerging relationship-building.\n1 3D. Coombs et al.\nThe importance of informal interactions was articulated by Umar, a teacher who\nrecommended, \u2018Enjoy all the experiences, but make sure you talk to the Elders on\nthe bus. That was the big thing\u2019. These spontaneous conversations kindled Umar\u2019s\ngrowing awareness of the lives of local Aboriginal Elders. They gave him a new\nunderstanding of Country and community and he felt a connection and desire to\nlearn more. LFC gave the teachers the opportunity to sit down with Elders and hear\nstories about Country and the community. These conversations inspired teachers like\nDaisy, who echoed many of Umar\u2019s sentiments. She explained that LFC gave her\nthe confidence to incorporate Aboriginal pedagogies and content into her classroom.\nShe created resources for students that drew from Yunkaporta and Shillingsworth\u2019s\n(2020) relationally responsive standpoint, trying new methods that prioritised\nrespecting and connecting:\nI had those ideas and I started to put it into my practices\u2026And these Abo-\nriginal styles of education, alongside the current teaching that we have, I felt\nit gave me more confidence to work towards doing that. And then also feeling\nlike, you know, when needed to, we could call on those Elders to come in, we\ncould organise it to share parts of culture that obviously, as a non-Indigenous\nperson I cannot share with the kids. (Daisy)\nWhile it is positive that teachers feel confident engaging Aboriginal community\nmembers in their classrooms, in practice it is important to consider the competing\npriorities of Aboriginal community members, which may complicate this approach.\nBuilding culturally safe classrooms\nSeveral teachers realised that by building relationships with families and communi-\nties they could develop trusting relationships with their students, creating culturally\nsafe classrooms. Estelle explains how her greater involvement with Aboriginal edu-\ncation is strengthening her connection with students:\nI think doing the (CNS) program, being on the (Aboriginal) education team,\nthat builds that rapport, so they let their guard down. And once they start open-\ning up about these things, then instantly you\u2019ve got that connection. So - to be\na safe person, you know?\nEstelle is recognising that although she is not Aboriginal, she can become a cul-\nturally safe person for her Aboriginal students. One of her school\u2019s goals is to be a\nplace not just where Aboriginal culture is foregrounded but to be a place of safety\nfor Aboriginal students and their families. In this, the school seeks to uncouple itself\nfrom the processes of colonisation, the legacy of which is still evident in the school-\ning system. This ongoing process is visible through the ways students are taught\n(including the explicit and hidden curricula), deficit thinking by teachers and near\nexclusive reliance on Western pedagogies and practices that reinforce the dominant\nculture (Burgess & Evans, 2017). Schools were also heavily implicated in the histor-\nical arbitrary and forced removal of Aboriginal children from their families, with the\nrepercussions being felt for generations (Bishop et al., 2019; Morrison et al., 2019).\n1 3The impact of Learning from Country on teachers\u2019 understandings\u2026\nEstelle and other CNS teachers like her, are beginning to understand the importance\nof cultural safety:\nYou care. Like, that\u2019s also a really big part of Culturally Nourishing School-\ning, its literally just caring about them and getting to know them, so that they\nfeel safe and they feel known.\nShe can see how much her students value her empathy and care:\nAnd you can see it in their eyes, it means so much to them. I had no idea how\nmuch that would mean to them. And when I joined the Aboriginal education\nteam, how much it meant to them, that I was, you know, with them and cared\nenough to be part of them.\nRelating curriculum to students\u2019 lives\nA significant element of the LFC experiences involves educating the teachers about\nthe socio-political history of the community, the school\u2019s place within that and how\nfamilies are connected. This helped teachers include relevant aspects of Aboriginal\nstudents\u2019 and their families\u2019 lived experiences in the curriculum. For example, local\nhistory lessons gave teachers, including Nick, new insights into students\u2019 lives and\nways to connect to them:\nI can even reflect on last year versus this year, I guess I\u2019m able to relate with\nthem a little bit more now. Because I understand them and where they come\nfrom more, so I\u2019m able to relate, which instantly starts a conversation.\nSimilarly, teacher Gabriel articulated how his heightened sense of the socio-polit-\nical context had strengthened his connection with people in the community:\nEven just sort of, you know, knowing more people in the community and get-\nting stronger with that. Building that tie, those ties.\nBoth Nick and Gabriel expressed how their growing awareness of Aboriginal his-\ntory and the legacies of colonisation have affected their intellectual and relational\nprocesses; they appear to be wrestling with issues of racism and dispossession that\ncontinue to affect their students (Bishop & Durksen, 2020). While Nick felt embar-\nrassed by his ignorance, a result of his minimal interaction with Aboriginal peo-\nple, Gabriel experienced feelings of discomfort. Being both white and English,\nhe is cognisant of his home country\u2019s invasion and colonisation of Australia. He\nis conscious of the dynamics that this separateness brings into his classroom as he\nattempts to relate to his Aboriginal students. He is also more aware of the impact of\npower dynamics on his interactions and relationships with students:\nThere\u2019s a saying that the land has never been ceded. To me, that also means\nthe power to rule has also never been ceded, the power to form our own gov-\nernment has never been ceded, the power to have a decision on what our\neducation system should look like has never been ceded, it\u2019s all these things.\n(Gabriel)\n1 3D. Coombs et al.\nThe decolonising potential of these relationships reflects the ways in which LFC\nsubverts traditional structures. It recognises Country (Harrison & Skrebneva, 2020;\nLowe et. al., 2020), or Elders, as the teacher. Bishop et al. (2019) describes this as \u2018a\nshift in traditional power dynamics and classroom practices; challenging dominant\nknowledge hierarchies and whose knowledge is valued\u2019 (p. 13). This is echoed by\nBond\u2019s (2010) study of Elders on the Mornington Peninsula where the community\nprioritised the need for teachers to \u2018form caring, compassionate and respectful rela-\ntionships with the senior Indigenous members of the community\u2019 (p. 44). Teachers\u2019\nemergent understanding of the value of First Nations \u2018cultural processes\u2019 (Yunka-\nporta & Shillingsworth, 2020, p. 3), due in large part to the LFC experiences and\nthe CNS project more broadly, enables them to conceptualise and enact classroom\npractices that are based in relational responsiveness. Teachers inherently know that\nrelationships are central to what they do but Western schooling models, which tend\nto separate teaching from relating, act to suppress this knowledge. As Nick says,\nwhen reflecting on how he will implement LFC in his teaching, \u2018The whole thing of\nthis has made me realise that I\u2019m not going to do it alone\u2019. This teacher is therefore\nacknowledging that this work sits within a whole-school reform approach. Develop-\ning a relationally responsive standpoint through being on Country and in community\nallows teachers to enact processes that centre relationality.\nConclusion\nThrough close engagement with the reflections and discussions within the Cultur-\nally Nourishing Schooling project, we found evidence that Learning from Country\nis providing teachers with a range of positive insights and capacities in Aboriginal\neducation. This enhanced capacity for developing their critical consciousness, which\nbecame particularly evident in the processes of respecting and connecting. We found\nthat the LFC experiences are giving teachers the time, the community connections,\nand the Country-based knowledge to enable them to develop place-based pedagogies\nin their teaching. Through a deeper understanding of the local historical and political\ncontext, teachers were prompted to consider what it means to teach on unceded Abo-\nriginal land. Our findings suggest that CNS teachers are starting to think and act in\nways that are very different to the dominant theories and practices of schooling and\neducation in Australia. We argue that CNS teachers are reflecting Aboriginal val-\nues, perspectives and worldviews, illustrated in Yunkaporta\u2019s and Shillingsworth\u2019s\n(2020) relationally responsive standpoint. We conclude that LFC is having a positive\nimpact on teachers\u2019 capacities to teach in culturally nourishing ways, improving the\nexperiences and chances of success for Aboriginal school students. If all teachers,\nand indeed students, participated in regular LFC activities, it is likely that this would\ngo some way towards improving Aboriginal and Torres Strait education outcomes\nand reconciling the differences between schools and Aboriginal communities. More\nresearch is needed to better understand how Aboriginal students and families per-\nceive and experience the impacts of LFC on classroom pedagogy and practice and\non school-community relationships and if we can move closer towards decolonising\nschooling through these processes.\n1 3The impact of Learning from Country on teachers\u2019 understandings\u2026\nAuthor contributions David Coombs: David Coombs led the data analysis process, organised authors\u2019\nmeetings and the division of work, developed the key arguments in the paper, wrote the methods section,\nthe introduction and conclusion and contributed to the overall editing of the paper.
