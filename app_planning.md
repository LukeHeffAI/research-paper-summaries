# Master Planning Document

## Tool description

This tool is designed to be a simple way for a user, especially one without coding skills, to engage with the latest AI technology to synthesise large amounts of information into short, easy to digest forms. The interface is yet to be decided, but the user will simply move large knowledge documents (e.g. research papers) into a folder or upload them to a website, and within a short amount of time have a document returned that provides summaries and other key information from the paper for them to use. Some of this information will be based on a user profile, while other information will be provided at run time to direct this particular task.

## User profile

### Researchers

This tool will initially assume that each user is focused on research and will be able to use the tool to plan their research projects. The tool will be designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, so that researchers can easily navigate the tool and use it to plan their research projects.
As we move through development stages, the tool will also be designed to be more flexible, so that researchers can use it to plan a wide range of research projects, from small-scale studies to large-scale research projects.

We expect researchers to use the tool to plan their research projects, including defining research questions, selecting research methods, and creating research plans. Researchers will also be able to use the tool to track their progress and manage their research projects.
