## Progress journal, 2024-11-11

### Done today

- Restructured the directories to make user folders at the top of the hierarchy.
- Added a new user

### Problems

- I'm not sure how to handle the user's data apart from the current JSON files. I'm thinking of using a database, but I'm not sure how to set it up.
- I've restructed the directories, but I'm not sure if this is the best way to do it or whether I have found all the places where I need to change the paths.

### To do

- Move user data to user folders.
- Set up a database for the user data.
- Create a new user class to handle the user data.
- Create a new branch
  - Add ability to force build LaTeX files.
  - Remove the connection to the Overleaf API.
